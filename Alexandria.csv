3 Bedroom, Single-story Townhomes for rent in Winterset, IA

Did you know you could lease a ranch style townhome for about the same cost as renting an apartment? The conveniences of an apartment with the enjoyment of your own front door, yard and attached garage. Upgrade your apartment experience to townhome living with Kading!

We offer affordable living with desired amenities such as washer/dryer hook-ups, cable ready units, air conditioning, ceramic tile flooring in all common areas and carpeted bedrooms & living rooms. Open concept floor plans provide ultimate flexibility to decorate your personal space and make it your own. Let your kids enjoy a space to play – whether your little humans or your little fur babies. Lawn care, snow management, pet stations, and 24-hour emergency maintenance are provided. We take on the upkeep so you can take back your time!

Enjoy the seasons in Madison County! The irresistible historic town square, the local wineries & eateries, and the six famous covered bridges amidst the rolling emerald hills provide a veritable feast for the senses throughout all four seasons! As the county seat of Madison County, Winterset houses a dazzling French Renaissance Revival-style courthouse as its centerpiece, surrounded by modern commercial businesses to serve your needs while preserving the local heritage and Italianate buildings’ charm.

Glenwood by Kading is conveniently located just two blocks from Highway 169/92 with easy access to downtown Winterset, or to Interstates 35 or 80 if you’re venturing out of town. Though, we’re not sure why you would want to leave! The sense of community pride, friendliness of local shopkeepers, strong schools, and surrounding natural landscape provide that calming, stress-free, small town life; yet only 35 minutes away from all the benefits of the Des Moines metro area!

Kading builds with you in mind. We understand your need for affordable independence. Our team works hard to provide a genuine community feel - a safe haven in a convenient location.

We are dedicated to supporting our residents through superior care and responsiveness to your needs. We offer an online tenant portal making it easy to communicate with us to sign or renew your lease, make timely payments, and place service requests all from the convenience of your laptop, tablet, or smartphone.

We hope you choose to make our house your home!

This attractive property offers many interior and exterior features and updates, including a new lifetime dimensional shingled roof with 130 mph wind rating (installed in November 2021), newer engineered hardwood flooring in the living room, newer carpet, new front door, and storm door. The sellers have also enlarged the back deck (now 29' x 15'), changed the location of the sliding glass door and window to create a better flow, and added the 16' x 12' shed with loft and workbench, garage shelving and workbench, a keypad entry to the front door, landscaping and the playset in the past few years. The house features oversized bedrooms, lots of natural light, a split bedroom design, lots of storage, and a wonderful backyard and privacy fence. The current owners love the neighbors and the neighborhood and the convenience to Lakeside Elementary School, which is within walking distance. You will love the close proximity to Lake Monroe (only three miles to the nearest boat ramp and Fairfax Beach) for lots of fun in the sun. You're only three miles from Highway 37 as well, which is very handy for Crane commuters or anyone needing to zip up the I-69 Interstate. Enjoy the benefits of a rural subdivision with the convenience of being close to everything in lovely Lakewood Hills! Notes: Playset stays. Please note it on a separate addendum if a lender is involved. Excludes garage fridge.

  , 45 looking for a room to rent. I would like to be within 30 mins of McKinney but this is open. I am a country girl with 2 small dogs and a chinchilla. I work full time. I can cook, clean, organize and do household chores. I used to own my own home and small farm so I know how to take care of one. I am a kid/animal lover. :) I am open to helping out in exchange for reduced rent or reasonable rent. https://dallas.craigslist.org/ftw/sha/.html#:~:text=HelloHello :) I'm looking for a room for me and my mom until the end of the month - I'm a proofreader and my mom is a retired teacher .... I can pay you $200 . Thank you so much for your interest ! Have a great day :) Hi guys. I’m a gay . I’m a full time student. My housing budget was significantly reduced and need a place to live while I finish school. Lost my job as a framer when I was bit by a dog two weeks ago. Since then I've tried to find as much side work as I can but competition is fierce out here. If you have any sort of work that needs to be done or think you might be able to help us in any way please call or text me at . I'm a framer by trade but I also do all sorts of remodeling. Tile work, flooring ,grout, just about anything. Today's my last day before they throw me out on the street. It's too cold and I've never been in a situation like this. Please help my family and my self.I'm a 52-year-old man looking for a room for rent in Denton starting at the first of December. I've been in Jamestown, North Dakota for the last 3 months, and am planning to move back to Denton, where I've lived off and on since 1996. I'm drug-free and have an absolutely clean criminal background. I have a rock-solid monthly income from Social Security, and I also will be working a part-time job. Plus, I have a healthy bank balance. I'm currently working on a book project and spend my days out and about. Generally, I'm out the door no later than 8:00am and don't come back till after 5:00p, which means I wouldn't be hanging around inside all day running up your utility bill. Libraries and coffee houses are where I generally hang out doing research for my book. I am a cigarette smoker but will not smoke on your property. I drink a couple of beers in the evening but nothing excessive. I can provide great rental references and have always paid the rent on time. One thing: I'm very quiet and considerate, and expect the same in return, so if you're into blaring a TV or stereo that comes through the walls, hey, that's just not for me. Ditto a barking dog at night. So if you've got an extra room you're looking to make some money from, please feel free to contact me via the CraigsList email relay to start out.I'm posting this to see if someone can help us. My friend and I need a 2 bedroom apartment or house. Are budget is around $1000.00 a month. We both work and would be nice to have something for December. We're we are at now there evicting the person we're renting from. So we're kinda forced to move. We're looking for something in the old east Dallas area. in search of one-year lease in Keller, NRH, Watauga, East Fort Worth area. Wanting a furnished bedroom and private bath with utilities included (including WIFI). I will be moving out of state in approximately one year so looking for something temporary until then. I do not smoke. I work full time, of course. I'm quiet, clean, organized. I pay my rent on time, every time. I don't need to be entertained and spend my off-work hours reading, shopping or simply resting. I'm not looking for a relationship and I'm not a housekeeper or caregiver. I love pets of all kinds but have none of my own currently. If you could use some extra income and have an unused bedroom/bath, I'd love to hear from you! I can pay $600 monthly. Thanks for reading! Needing to Move out ASAP from rent house. Looking for serious inquires to take over the lease. Located in the hutto park subdivision. 3 bedroom, 2 bath, Garage attached, 2 parking spaces, Spacious patio. 1661 sq footage. Lease is up April 30th 2023. Rent is 1795 a month. Very nice neighborhood. W/D & Fridge not included. I am looking for a rental home in Austin (or surrounding areas). Austin is getting more and more expensive and I'm wanting to keep with the private landlord route! I am a filmmaker in Austin and make decent money as a private contractor but I'm currently working to build my credit as its not doing so great after the pandemic. I have two very friendly, but big dogs. They are well trained, love everyone, and are not destructive to property. I am open to the idea of a roommate, as long as they are cool with my puppers and there's plenty of space for everyone! My budget per month for rent would be around $900-1000. I know that's almost impossible to find in Austin, but that's why I'm posting here, just in case something pops up! Thanks for reading and feel free to reach out with any follow up questions, either as a potential roommate or landlord!"

  , 45 looking for a room to rent. I would like to be within 30 mins of McKinney but this is open. I am a country girl with 2 small dogs and a chinchilla. I work full time. I can cook, clean, organize and do household chores. I used to own my own home and small farm so I know how to take care of one. I am a kid/animal lover. :) I am open to helping out in exchange for reduced rent or reasonable rent. https://dallas.craigslist.org/ftw/sha/  .html#:~:text=HelloHello :) I'm looking for a room for me and my mom until the end of the month - I'm a proofreader and my mom is a retired teacher .... I can pay you $200 . Thank you so much for your interest ! Have a great day :) Hi guys. I’m a gay . I’m a full time student. My housing budget was significantly reduced and need a place to live while I finish school. Lost my job as a framer when I was bit by a dog two weeks ago. Since then I've tried to find as much side work as I can but competition is fierce out here. If you have any sort of work that needs to be done or think you might be able to help us in any way please call or text me at . I'm a framer by trade but I also do all sorts of remodeling. Tile work, flooring ,grout, just about anything. Today's my last day before they throw me out on the street. It's too cold and I've never been in a situation like this. Please help my family and my self.I'm a 52-year-old man looking for a room for rent in Denton starting at the first of December. I've been in Jamestown, North Dakota for the last 3 months, and am planning to move back to Denton, where I've lived off and on since 1996. I'm drug-free and have an absolutely clean criminal background. I have a rock-solid monthly income from Social Security, and I also will be working a part-time job. Plus, I have a healthy bank balance. I'm currently working on a book project and spend my days out and about. Generally, I'm out the door no later than 8:00am and don't come back till after 5:00p, which means I wouldn't be hanging around inside all day running up your utility bill. Libraries and coffee houses are where I generally hang out doing research for my book. I am a cigarette smoker but will not smoke on your property. I drink a couple of beers in the evening but nothing excessive. I can provide great rental references and have always paid the rent on time. One thing: I'm very quiet and considerate, and expect the same in return, so if you're into blaring a TV or stereo that comes through the walls, hey, that's just not for me. Ditto a barking dog at night. So if you've got an extra room you're looking to make some money from, please feel free to contact me via the CraigsList email relay to start out.I'm posting this to see if someone can help us. My friend and I need a 2 bedroom apartment or house. Are budget is around $1000.00 a month. We both work and would be nice to have something for December. We're we are at now there evicting the person we're renting from. So we're kinda forced to move. We're looking for something in the old east Dallas area. in search of one-year lease in Keller, NRH, Watauga, East Fort Worth area. Wanting a furnished bedroom and private bath with utilities included (including WIFI). I will be moving out of state in approximately one year so looking for something temporary until then. I do not smoke. I work full time, of course. I'm quiet, clean, organized. I pay my rent on time, every time. I don't need to be entertained and spend my off-work hours reading, shopping or simply resting. I'm not looking for a relationship and I'm not a housekeeper or caregiver. I love pets of all kinds but have none of my own currently. If you could use some extra income and have an unused bedroom/bath, I'd love to hear from you! I can pay $600 monthly. Thanks for reading! Needing to Move out ASAP from rent house. Looking for serious inquires to take over the lease. Located in the hutto park subdivision. 3 bedroom, 2 bath, Garage attached, 2 parking spaces, Spacious patio. 1661 sq footage. Lease is up April 30th 2023. Rent is 1795 a month. Very nice neighborhood. W/D & Fridge not included. I am looking for a rental home in Austin (or surrounding areas). Austin is getting more and more expensive and I'm wanting to keep with the private landlord route! I am a filmmaker in Austin and make decent money as a private contractor but I'm currently working to build my credit as its not doing so great after the pandemic. I have two very friendly, but big dogs. They are well trained, love everyone, and are not destructive to property. I am open to the idea of a roommate, as long as they are cool with my puppers and there's plenty of space for everyone! My budget per month for rent would be around $900-1000. I know that's almost impossible to find in Austin, but that's why I'm posting here, just in case something pops up! Thanks for reading and feel free to reach out with any follow up questions, either as a potential roommate or landlord!

The 2007 expansion of Asynchrony Solutions onto the ground floor resulted in the restoration of long-filled-in windows at the street. Barely visible on the building's west face are the faded remains of numerous advertising signs. Among the more legible ones are ads for Wrigley's Spearmint gum and for the building's one-time tenant, King Bee Hats.

Located near the CTA Western Ave. station, these modern Logan Square apartments offer luxury living in one of Chicago’s most eclectic neighborhoods.  

Apartments here are housed in two buildings, both four stories tall, which are connected by an elevated private courtyard with lovely landscaping. Each unit features tall ceilings, large sunny windows, hardwood floors, and modern kitchens with 5-burner gas range, quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances, and wide-plank wood floors throughout. In-unit washers and dryers are included in all units. Some layouts feature outdoor terraces.
 
Community amenities abound at this boutique property, including a fitness center, resident lounge, and a landscaped courtyard with an outdoor kitchen and comfy patio lounge furniture. Onsite services include a Stockwell smart store, Tide Dry Cleaners, Luxer One Package System, and bicycle storage and repair station. 

Pets are welcome with breed restrictions, and there is an on-site dog washing station. You’ll find the 606 elevated trail and adjacent neighborhood park are nearby within a short walk. 

There are no less than five coffee shops, a wide variety of restaurants and several notable local attractions within in walking distance.  Aldi is the closest large grocery store, but there are several local neighborhood markets that stock your everyday essentials.  

Getting around town is a breeze! There are three bus routes that converge at the intersection down the street, and the CTA Blue Line Western station is less than a 5-minute walk.  Drivers can get to I-90 within a few minutes via Armitage Ave. Also, Metra has two regional trains that stop at the Clybourn Station, about a 25-minute walk, or about 12 minutes via #73 bus.

The building was already used as artists' lofts in the 1980s; in 1999 it was wholey residential. A 2003 renovation converted it to 33 condominiums. The 2007 expansion of Asynchrony Solutions onto the ground floor resulted in the restoration of long-filled-in windows at the street. Barely visible on the building's west face are the faded remains of numerous advertising signs. Among the more legible ones are ads for Wrigley's Spearmint gum and for the building's one-time tenant, King Bee Hats.

Available for Fall of 2023 (next August)
Looking for a peaceful, quiet place just off campus and close to downtown Champaign for next August? We got you!


If you like units in converted homes, this might be a good match for you. This approximately 500 square foot, upstairs unit features a big bedroom with two closets, a smaller but just-refreshed kitchen (new flooring, cabinets, and new stove) with a breakfast nook, and a cozy living room. The bathroom was just remodeled, too, with new flooring, cabinets, and fixtures. It features a full tub (with a shower head, of course!). And we just finished replacing every window in the unit. 412 W. Green in Champaign is only a half-mile from campus, straight down Green Street. And it's on bus lines. The property is close to shopping, dining, and The Champaign Public Library is just 2 blocks away.  


And it's a great price, too!
So what's a simple, private unit just off-campus with on-site, tenant-only laundry, plenty of parking, additional storage available, that includes water, garbage/recycling, and even heat in the winter go for? How about if we throw in dedicated GIGABIT FIBER OPTIC internet? Would you believe it's just $727 per month? Check out the images below, then contact us for a private tour!

Would you like to live in a park? Huge Green space! 

Looking for someplace not like all the others, a place where Madison's largest park is just across the street? Well, you will love these apartments, directly on Warner Park next to the recreation center with indoor basketball/volleyball courts, a full gym, wide screen TV, and pool tables. The park has Madison's finest dog park and a path that leads you to the lake. There are also baseball diamonds, sled hills, tennis courts, and a playground we have incredible two-bedroom apartments. Some have dishwashers, microwaves, washers, and dryers others with porches overlooking the park. We have many types of buildings that we know you will live in the layout of at least one of them. 

Off-street parking, on site management, means we stand by our neighborhood and understand how to find the best neighbors to move into our community. We allow most dogs but we are a peaceful place and we like our dog breeds that way too! Laundry on-site, tree-lined and jogging trails, ponds for fishing, grills with picnic tables, and even a hockey rink in the winter! Living in one of Madison's largest parks has great value. Trails right to Lake Mendota. Too many amenities in this park to list all of them. 

Low utility costs during winter, we pay heat!! We have remodeled kitchens and on-site laundry! A supermarket Willy Street Co-Op is just blocked away, with a public library, Walgreens, Butter Barbecue, a Dollar Store, an Italian restaurant, and much more. Call today to reserve a showing. We schedule showings all week long with a customer service team that will make time to boast about the best. So call us today!

Dogs and cats are welcome. Some breed restrictions. Welcome home, please call us now for an appointment. 
Call me now! Rents start at $899.00

The building was already used as artists' lofts in the 1980s; in 1999 it was wholey residential. A 2003 renovation converted it to 33 condominiums. The 2007 expansion of Asynchrony Solutions onto the ground floor resulted in the restoration of long-filled-in windows at the street. Barely visible on the building's west face are the faded remains of numerous advertising signs. Among the more legible ones are ads for Wrigley's Spearmint gum and for the building's one-time tenant, King Bee Hats.

Looking for someplace not like all the others, a place where Madison's largest park is just across the street? Well, you will love these apartments, directly on Warner Park next to the recreation center with indoor basketball/volleyball courts, a full gym, widescreen TV, and pool tables. The park has Madison's finest dog park and a path that leads you to the lake. There are also baseball diamonds, sled hills, tennis courts, and the playground we have incredible two-bedroom apartments. Some have dishwashers, microwaves, washers, and dryers other with porches overlooking the park. We have many types of buildings that we know you will live in the layout of at least one of them. 

Off-street parking and on-site manager mean we stand by our neighborhood and understand how to find the best neighbors to move into our community. We allow most dogs but we are a peaceful place and we like our dog breeds that way too! Laundry on-site, tree-lined, and jogging trails, ponds for fishing, grills with picnic tables, and even a hockey rink in the winter! Living in one of Madison's largest parks has great value. Trails right to Lake Mendota. Too many amenities in this park to list all of them. 

Low utility costs during winter!! We have remodeled kitchens and on-site laundry! A supermarket THE WILLY STREET CO-OP is just a block away, with a public library, Walgreen's, Butter Barbecue, a Dollar Store, an Italian restaurant, and much more. Call today to reserve a showing. We schedule showings all week long with a customer service team that will make time to boast about the best. So call us today!

There are also baseball diamonds, sled hills, tennis courts, and the playground we have incredible two-bedroom apartments. Some have dishwashers, microwaves, washers, and dryers other with porches overlooking the park. We have many types of buildings that we know you will live in the layout of at least one of them.

Laundry on-site, tree-lined, and jogging trails, ponds for fishing, grills with picnic tables, and even a hockey rink in the winter! Living in one of Madison's largest parks has great value. Trails right to Lake Mendota. Too many amenities in this park to list all of them.

Some have dishwashers, microwaves, washers, and dryers other with porches overlooking the park. We have many types of buildings that we know you will live the layout of at least one of them. 

Off-street parking, on-site manager means we stand by our neighborhood and really understand how to find the best neighbors to move into our community. We allow most dogs but we are a peaceful place and we like our dog breeds that way too! Laundry on site, tree-lined, and jogging trails, ponds for fishing, grills with picnic tables, even a hockey rink in the winter! Living on one of Madison's largest parks has great value. Trails right to Lake Mendota. Too many amenities in this park to list all of them.

Home will be coming up for rent in Dec. Our awesome tenants are in the move process at this time so when that is completed we will do some routine maintenance and then start setting up appt. to show. Probably first week of Dec. Very country shabby chic feel. This property sits back from the main st on a private dirt rd 1/2 mile behind a locked gate shared with 2 other homes. This home has a private country feel. These pics were taken 3 years ago before our current tenants moved in. We will update the pics later when we are able but it should be very similar as 3 years ago we put in new carpet, windows, hvac system, stainless steel appliances, new paint, . Property runs on pg&e and propane. We will be putting in a new hotter heater before new tenants enter as well as some repainting. Small out buildings. Sorry no covered parking. Expect your cars will get dirty as this is country living.

You may purchase the home at anytime, if you so choose. This is a 45-60 day process once we have secured the home you chose. Our office has conducted over 80 transactions with this investment firm, so if you are NOT working with an agent, please contact me with your name and email address, and or phone number, and I will email you an invite to the program so you can navigate, and see if this program is for you. This is not a listing of Re/Max Premiere Realty, but when you send me your information, I will email you an invite to the program where you can register and see this house and others.

* There also is another program which is more based on income, assets, and debt ratio vs. a credit score, and includes the entire St. Louis Metro area.

UTILIZE THIS PROGRAM TO LEASE AND/OR BUY IN THE FUTURE THIS  stunning 2 story home in the New Town subdivision! The 4 bed/2.5 bath home built in 2020 is beautifully maintained and ready for your arrival. Upon walking in, you are immediately greeted by the open concept throughout the main. The living room extends out to the bonus room for extra space and the eat-in kitchen includes SS appliances, a breakfast bar, and a nicely sized dining area for all of your home cooked meals! Upstairs you will find the master suite with large walk-in closet and oversized private bath with double vanity and separate shower and tub. 3 additional bedrooms span the rest of the upstairs with a shared full bath! Downstairs you will find the partially finished LL with included egress, recreation room, and rough-in bath for any addition your heart desires! In the back of the home you will find the 2 car garage and driveway and patio to hangout on. Don't forget the beautiful front curb appeal with full landscaping and porch! Check it out today.


It’s a great option if you:
• Want to live in a single-family home, in a great community with quality schools
• Are a first-time homebuyer who’s cautious about buying a home now, but may want to buy in the future
• Are a home seeker in the process of relocating but aren’t sure where you want to settle down
