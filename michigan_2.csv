If you're looking for a classic single family house near German Village and you're willing to do your own upgrading, you REALLY need to see 215 East Jenkins Avenue!

Are you handy? Want to buy a house? Read on...
Is this you?
- You know how to do basic work on a house
- You have a job
- You want to buy a house in the Greater Columbus area, 
- But you don’t have the right credit or down payment to get a bank loan

If so, I MIGHT be able to help.
I owner lease / option houses that need work to qualified handypeople.
Typically, the houses I sell need cosmetics (paint, flooring, landscaping, bath & kitchen updates).

This 3 bedroom, 1.5 bath home near Thurman’s Café almost has too many features to mention, but here's the big one:
-Original woodwork, beautiful staircase, and hardwood floors
-25 solar panels for low utilities
-Large kitchen with Stainless steel appliances
-Deep fenced yard

It's available with LEASE OPTION to purchase for a renter/ buyer who is willing and able to do the painting, upgrading and ongoing maintenance it needs...

All the major systems (roof, HVAC, electric, etc) are good, but the house needs interior painting, hardwood floors refreshed, and the kitchen and baths are functional but need some TLC.

It's priced accordingly at $325,000 (we think that the fixed up value is in the $400k+) AND we'll lease option it with $15,000 option fee (don't have all of that? We may be able to work with you) and monthly payments of $2850/mo. (we think it would rent in the $3,500/mo range fixed up) to the renter/ buyer who has the skills and resources to do the work and make it the awesome house it should be.

We only have 2 big qualifications. The first is that you have enough consistent income to easily make the payments. The other is that you have the skills and resources to do the upgrades that this house needs and be able to maintain it once you've moved in.

If that's you and you'd like to know more about the house, the deal, or set up a showing so you can see the inside, please reply!

"$2,550",/ 2br - ,Downtown AA Beautiful loft (furnished if you'd like),"
        
            QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Available for move in within a month.

Looking for someone to take over the lease for this 2 bedroom loft on Main St. and Liberty in downtown Ann Arbor right above from Shalimar across from Starbucks. 

The current lease goes through July (though can flexibly end as early as end of February or as late as end of June if we decide now -- the landlord is flexible). I'd like to give the person currently living there a couple weeks to move out, but beyond that it's available fairly immediately. Parking is in a structure 30 seconds walk away (I timed it), and about $220 a month. You'd take over utilities.

I'd mostly prefer to have someone take over the lease, and I'd get my stuff out of there. However, if you'd like a beautifully FURNISHED space at a bit of a lower price and are moving in within weeks we could do this another way: I could leave it completely furnished. I'd leave my personal stuff boxed in the second bedroom as storage and there's tons of space for your stuff as well. The 1st bedroom has a very expensive king sized bed (cost about 5k and is a sleep game changer). There's also a projector that takes up the whole wall against the bed. I have videos I can send.

To schedule a 10-minute phone interview to discuss use this link. (ADHD here, this is the only way I stay organized!)

Furnished house, 1300 sqft, 3 bedroom and 1 bath on a quiet cul-de-sac in the Normal Park neighborhood of Ypsilanti. There is a large backyard and a 2 car garage. Washer and dryer in the house as well as dish washer (and all the standard appliances). Also, this house has a ""cateo"" at the back so this could be a plus for you if you have a cat or cats.

The house is in a neighborhood called Normal Park. It's a lovely area, very walkable and has a community pool. The residents are very active on social media and it's just a great community to be in.

The house is located within walking distance of EMU (5 min), multiple restaurants and bars and a 5 min drive to a supermarket (Fresh Thyme). It's a 15 min drive into Ann Arbor (depending the area), about 17 min to UofM Hospital (8 miles) and only 5 min away from St Joe's Hospital. It's in a great location for any visiting professor, student or medical worker. Schools are also close by if you have kids.

I will be adding more pictures soon, I'm in the process of freshening up the paint and adding furniture (so rest assured there will be a sofa, chair(s) and tv 🙂). Also, apologies for the mess in the kitchen, it will be cleaned up soon, I just wanted to give you an idea of what it looks like.

Open to short term leases or longer leases. The house will be available as of December.

Thanks!
