Beautiful 2 BR first floor apt, big living room with a built-in air conditioner, re-decorated eat-in kitchen with refrigerator, stove and lots of cabinet space. Both bedrooms have double closets and hardwood floors. There is one assigned parking space included, shared porches and a storage locker and laundry in the basement. Close to Wauwatosa, major bus lines and easy access to downtown. Building has a history of good long-term tenants. Security deposit is $725. Available between Nov. 15 and Dec. 1st. Pictures are not the actual apt that will be available but are very similar to it. The biggest difference is the color of the appliances, instead of white, the stove is black and the refrigerator is stainless steel.

During the worst of COVID-19, I started doing pre-screening and private showings to limit everyone's exposure to it. I found this approach to be more effective and efficient than my old method of having an ""open house"" so I have decided to continue it even though COVID-19 is less of and issue than it was then. If you are reading this ad, the apt is still available.
Please reply by email if you have more questions or are interested in providing the information I need to pre-screen. If you prefer to discuss the apt by phone you can call Jerry at 262-789-86twotwo, however, all pre-screen info needs to be given via email.

Info needed for pre-screen (you can copy this, hit ""reply"" above the ad title, then paste and fill it out in your email reply, please provide the info for each adult who will be residing at apt):

-Full name and birth date of each adult who will be residing at apt ________________________
-Name(s) and age(s) of child(ren) that will be living with you____________________________
-Current address________________________How long?_________Your phone #_____________
-Landlord name and contact info_________________________________________
-Current Employer_______________Starting date_______Gross Monthly Income______
Employer Address and Phone #___________________________ Job Title____________
-Additional Monthly income and source___________________________________

After doing the pre-screening I will contact the applicants who are likely to be approved to schedule a private showing.

Some of the Qualifications:
*Must be 18 years or over
*Must have at least $2200/Mo in verifiable household gross income
*Bring Photo ID to showing, also having proof of income at that time will expedite an application
*Be able to get WE Energies in your name
*Able to pay FULL Security deposit within a day of application approval
*No evictions in past 10 yrs.

Property is owned by a WI Licensed Real Estate Broker

Property Description
You feel it even before you see it. A sense of wonder: leafy trees and vast blue skies catch your eye, as if for the first time. A spirit of refreshment: genuine kindness from our helpful staff, and an atmosphere of calm throughout.You glance around, in awe of so much… space. Private entryways wind toward buildings which tower more like townhomes than the crammed apartments you’re used to. Interiors gleam with that “freshly done” feel: refinished kitchen cabinets; gray appliances; wood-look flooring, just the way you like. Tranquil as it is, it’s almost shocking that the freeways sit so close: M-5, I-275, I-696 and I-96 all within one mile for when your 9-5 beckons toward Troy, Detroit or Novi. As the weekend draws near, you can’t wait to stroll through downtown Farmington for live music and local fare. Welcome to Spring Valley Apartments: a breath of fresh air, and a place you’re proud to call home.

This is a spacious SUNNY one-bedroom apartment. I am subletting until the lease expires at the and of May, so you would have the option to extend the lease if you wanted to stay. I can be flexible at the end of Dec about move in dates.

I am willing to negotiate about leaving some of the furnishings/paint on the wall/AC unit, but mostly the apartment will be unfurnished.

Electricity, gas and wifi are separate. There is laundry and bike storage in the basement of the building. The building is pet friendly.

You'd be renting with a leasing company. They are very good about responding to maintenance issues/other issues. They are convenient and easy to work with. They charge $60 for maintenance fees. They also require a $50 background check for sub-letter, and that you have renter's insurance.

The neighborhood is great. One block from 53rd. 1-ish mile from UChicago

Property Description
You feel it even before you see it. A sense of wonder: leafy trees and vast blue skies catch your eye, as if for the first time. A spirit of refreshment: genuine kindness from our helpful staff, and an atmosphere of calm throughout.You glance around, in awe of so much… space. Private entryways wind toward buildings which tower more like townhomes than the crammed apartments you’re used to. Interiors gleam with that “freshly done” feel: refinished kitchen cabinets; gray appliances; wood-look flooring, just the way you like. Tranquil as it is, it’s almost shocking that the freeways sit so close: M-5, I-275, I-696 and I-96 all within one mile for when your 9-5 beckons toward Troy, Detroit or Novi. As the weekend draws near, you can’t wait to stroll through downtown Farmington for live music and local fare. Welcome to Spring Valley Apartments: a breath of fresh air, and a place you’re proud to call home.

Light and bright, this two-story coach house cottage faces on a courtyard garden and is a perfect  romantic getaway right in the city. Upstairs is an airy 400-square-foot space with a cathedral ceiling, lighting inset into beams and oak floors laid on the diagonal. The kitchen, in one corner, features a 1963 Chambers stove and counter seating. A sliding glass door on the side opens onto a huge deck, while two sliding doors in front open onto a smaller balcony. The bedroom, also with oak floors, is downstairs and has closets across the back wall. Adjacent is a tiled bathroom and dressing area. The apartment has its own furnace; ask about heat and electric costs. 

Just minutes from the Mag Mile by bus (which stops on the corner) or bike, the neighborhood has gotten super trendy. Right around the corner on Chicago Avenue are nifty boutiques, two upscale wine shops, and close to a dozen restaurants, among them Noble Thai, Opart Thai, Jeong and Flo. Noble Square’s other attractions--all within walking distance--range from  Frontier on Milwaukee Ave. to Green Grocer, Bari Foods, D’Amato’s, Tempesta, and Coalfire on Grand Ave. The apartment also is across Noble St. from Eckhart Park, which has an indoor swimming pool. 

If you're looking for quirky charm, this is the place for you. If central air, in-unit laundry, and a dishwasher are deal-breakers, don't bother to apply.

If there’s ever a problem, the owner lives right next door.

This cream city brick building was built in 1900 by the Schlitz brewery as a dance hall & saloon.  Prohibition prompted its conversion to 1920’s era apartments.  The available 2 bedroom unit is on the second floor.  The apartment features natural light, a dining room, clawfoot tub with shower, ample closets, high ceilings and hardwood floors.  

The building provides a quiet environment and offers coin laundry, basement lockable storage and a shared back yard with a raised bed garden for your use.  

The Urban Ecology Center, free tennis courts and running track are directly across the street, as are access to the Oak Leaf bike trail, community garden plots, Riverside Park and the Rotary Arboretum.  The Riverside Milwaukee Recreation site is across the playing fields, offering inexpensive art, fitness and other classes and a pool.  The East Side is a highly walkable neighborhood with great restaurants, theaters, the East Library and shopping.  The building is near bus lines and a bike share station.  

Responsive local landlords live 4 blocks away.

Rent is $1260 per month including heat (steam radiators) and water.  Tenant pays for electricity and cooking gas.
Lease through July 31, 2023 with security deposit of $1,275.  Tenant can inquire about renewing with a 1-year lease beginning August 1, 2023.
A garage parking space is available for an additional $85/month.

No smoking  
No pets
We can't accept applicants with past citations for behaviors disturbing to neighbors (noise violations, underage drinking, disorderly conduct, etc.) or histories of nonpayment.

Feel free to e-mail with questions or to request a showing - masks required during in-person showings.  Must pass background and credit checks before lease is offered. ($39 per person paid online).

Please beware - there is a scam in which real ads are copied by a scammer who puts his or her own e-mail in place of the original poster’s contact information.  If photos are not provided or the rent is less than $1260, you are likely seeing this scam.  We will always ask to meet you in person and will not ask for your unencrypted e-mail address until after we have met.  Never make a payment for this rental until after you have met us.

Property Description
You feel it even before you see it. A sense of wonder: leafy trees and vast blue skies catch your eye, as if for the first time. A spirit of refreshment: genuine kindness from our helpful staff, and an atmosphere of calm throughout.You glance around, in awe of so much… space. Private entryways wind toward buildings which tower more like townhomes than the crammed apartments you’re used to. Interiors gleam with that “freshly done” feel: refinished kitchen cabinets; gray appliances; wood-look flooring, just the way you like. Tranquil as it is, it’s almost shocking that the freeways sit so close: M-5, I-275, I-696 and I-96 all within one mile for when your 9-5 beckons toward Troy, Detroit or Novi. As the weekend draws near, you can’t wait to stroll through downtown Farmington for live music and local fare. Welcome to Spring Valley Apartments: a breath of fresh air, and a place you’re proud to call home.

Our community is conveniently located by Bronson Battle Creek, KCC, and Irving Park. Close to shopping, downtown shops, and the library, there is no shortage of places to go, within walking distance. Walk the trails of beautiful Irving park, or go downtown to see the sights.

Our community offers spacious floor plans with 2 or 3 bedrooms. Choose either a lower unit with a patio, or an upper unit with a balcony. All units have ground floor, private entrances, so those in a 2nd level unit don't have to worry about carrying groceries up icy stairs. There are 2 full bathrooms in every unit, as well as a full size washer and dryer, at no additional monthly cost.

Currently we have no open units, but you are welcome to get on the wait list at no cost. Please contact the office for details. At this time we are not offering tours.

Let us get you into your new home.

21-home SFR portfolio scattered about in Montgomery, AL. There are eleven 2-bedroom, eight 3-bedroom, and two 4-bedroom homes. The average asking price per home of $57,142 is significantly below the average home sales price of $248,793 (April 2022) in Montgomery, AL according to Culverhouse College of Business. The seller purchased the homes one at a time over the past decade. Upon acquisition, the seller deployed the necessary capital to improve the homes. Improvements include kitchen and bath remodels, roofs and repairs, new HVAC units where needed, as well as cosmetic alterations during tenant turns. The homes are 100% occupied. Gross rents are a little over $14,000 a month. Many of the tenants have been in place for more than two years. The portfolio is self-managed providing an investor the opportunity to employ a professional management company to improve operational efficiencies. Another immediate value-add opportunity is raising rents on the month to-month tenants.

$725,/ 2br - 600ft2 - ,Great 2 BR Apt,"
        
            QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Beautiful 2 BR first floor apt, big living room with a built-in air conditioner, re-decorated eat-in kitchen with refrigerator, stove and lots of cabinet space. Both bedrooms have double closets and hardwood floors. There is one assigned parking space included, shared porches and a storage locker and laundry in the basement. Close to Wauwatosa, major bus lines and easy access to downtown. Building has a history of good long-term tenants. Security deposit is $725. Available between Nov. 15 and Dec. 1st. Pictures are not the actual apt that will be available but are very similar to it. The biggest difference is the color of the appliances, instead of white, the stove is black and the refrigerator is stainless steel.

During the worst of COVID-19, I started doing pre-screening and private showings to limit everyone's exposure to it. I found this approach to be more effective and efficient than my old method of having an ""open house"" so I have decided to continue it even though COVID-19 is less of and issue than it was then. If you are reading this ad, the apt is still available.
Please reply by email if you have more questions or are interested in providing the information I need to pre-screen. If you prefer to discuss the apt by phone you can call Jerry at 262-789-86twotwo, however, all pre-screen info needs to be given via email.

Info needed for pre-screen (you can copy this, hit ""reply"" above the ad title, then paste and fill it out in your email reply, please provide the info for each adult who will be residing at apt):

-Full name and birth date of each adult who will be residing at apt ________________________
-Name(s) and age(s) of child(ren) that will be living with you____________________________
-Current address________________________How long?_________Your phone #_____________
-Landlord name and contact info_________________________________________
-Current Employer_______________Starting date_______Gross Monthly Income______
Employer Address and Phone #___________________________ Job Title____________
-Additional Monthly income and source___________________________________

After doing the pre-screening I will contact the applicants who are likely to be approved to schedule a private showing.

Some of the Qualifications:
*Must be 18 years or over
*Must have at least $2200/Mo in verifiable household gross income
*Bring Photo ID to showing, also having proof of income at that time will expedite an application
*Be able to get WE Energies in your name
*Able to pay FULL Security deposit within a day of application approval
*No evictions in past 10 yrs.

Property is owned by a WI Licensed Real Estate Broker

- The two smaller bedrooms come with closets, nightstands, lamp, full-size platform beds with built in drawers for storage and remote-controlled ceiling fans. The master bedroom comes with a queen bed instead. The bedrooms will be perfect accommodation for up to 2 people in each room. 
- FREE LAUNDRY facilities in the unit in the basement with top-of-the-line large-capacity front-loading washer and dryer
- Newly installed backyard fence and deck

The Neighborhood:
There are LOTS of great restaurants, coffee shops, bars, stores, music venues, parks and other attractions in the neighborhood. Bustling and trendy Wicker Park and Bucktown is a 10-minute walk or just 1 stop on the Blue line. Walking distance to 2 grocery stores (Fresh Market and Aldi).

Getting Around:
There is free parking on the streets nearby or you can get parking stickers from the city to park on the street. Western, Armitage and Milwaukee buses are right by the house or the Western blue line stop is less than 5 minutes away. Five stops on the Blue line will take you to the loop for business or recreation in about 15 minutes. Besides the train, there are buses that can help take you anywhere you need. And of course, there are also taxis and Ubers galore.

I can send you a video tour first. If still interested, I can then arrange an in-person viewing. Please note that this unit is located in a 2-unit building, which means please be respectful of your noise levels since others live in the building.

If you want an energized urban experience, River North Chicago is the neighborhood for you. Its unique blend of commerce, housing, and tourism makes it one of the most sought after neighborhoods in Chicago. Most River North residences are glass or brick high rises, and a smaller portion of residents live in converted warehouse lofts.

With easy access to Chicagoland highways (I-90/94 and Lakeshore Drive), CTA Brown Line and Red Line, and The Loop (within walking distance), commuting from River North is usually a breeze

Property Description
You feel it even before you see it. A sense of wonder: leafy trees and vast blue skies catch your eye, as if for the first time. A spirit of refreshment: genuine kindness from our helpful staff, and an atmosphere of calm throughout.You glance around, in awe of so much… space. Private entryways wind toward buildings which tower more like townhomes than the crammed apartments you’re used to. Interiors gleam with that “freshly done” feel: refinished kitchen cabinets; gray appliances; wood-look flooring, just the way you like. Tranquil as it is, it’s almost shocking that the freeways sit so close: M-5, I-275, I-696 and I-96 all within one mile for when your 9-5 beckons toward Troy, Detroit or Novi. As the weekend draws near, you can’t wait to stroll through downtown Farmington for live music and local fare. Welcome to Spring Valley Apartments: a breath of fresh air, and a place you’re proud to call home.

Property Description
You work hard enough. Why not enjoy your days? Summer Ridge sits four miles from Western Michigan University with Pfizer, Borgess Medical and Perrigo Co. nearby, which means less time in the car; more time poolside.Break a sweat in the cardio fitness center, or at the tennis and sand volleyball courts outside. Shoot some hoops at our basketball court, or lounge with a good book in our roomy clubhouse. And did we mention the lake? Of course, staying home’s just half the fun. With the Kalamazoo 10 theater and Maple Hill Mall a brisk walk away, dinner with friends at Applebee’s followed by the latest flick could become your new favorite pastime. Come enjoy each day when you call Summer Ridge, home.

Property Description
You feel it even before you see it. A sense of wonder: leafy trees and vast blue skies catch your eye, as if for the first time. A spirit of refreshment: genuine kindness from our helpful staff, and an atmosphere of calm throughout.You glance around, in awe of so much… space. Private entryways wind toward buildings which tower more like townhomes than the crammed apartments you’re used to. Interiors gleam with that “freshly done” feel: refinished kitchen cabinets; gray appliances; wood-look flooring, just the way you like. Tranquil as it is, it’s almost shocking that the freeways sit so close: M-5, I-275, I-696 and I-96 all within one mile for when your 9-5 beckons toward Troy, Detroit or Novi. As the weekend draws near, you can’t wait to stroll through downtown Farmington for live music and local fare. Welcome to Spring Valley Apartments: a breath of fresh air, and a place you’re proud to call home.

Beautiful 2 BR first floor apt, big living room with a built-in air conditioner, re-decorated eat-in kitchen with refrigerator, stove and lots of cabinet space. Both bedrooms have double closets and hardwood floors. There is one assigned parking space included, shared porches and a storage locker and laundry in the basement. Close to Wauwatosa, major bus lines and easy access to downtown. Building has a history of good long-term tenants. Security deposit is $725. Available between Nov. 15 and Dec. 1st. Pictures are not the actual apt that will be available but are very similar to it. The biggest difference is the color of the appliances, instead of white, the stove is black and the refrigerator is stainless steel.

During the worst of COVID-19, I started doing pre-screening and private showings to limit everyone's exposure to it. I found this approach to be more effective and efficient than my old method of having an ""open house"" so I have decided to continue it even though COVID-19 is less of and issue than it was then. If you are reading this ad, the apt is still available. 
Please reply by email if you have more questions or are interested in providing the information I need to pre-screen. If you prefer to discuss the apt by phone you can call Jerry at 262-789-86twotwo, however, all pre-screen info needs to be given via email.

Info needed for pre-screen (you can copy this, hit ""reply"" above the ad title, then paste and fill it out in your email reply, please provide the info for each adult who will be residing at apt):

-Full name and birth date of each adult who will be residing at apt ________________________
-Name(s) and age(s) of child(ren) that will be living with you____________________________
-Current address________________________How long?_________Your phone #_____________
-Landlord name and contact info_________________________________________
-Current Employer_______________Starting date_______Gross Monthly Income______
Employer Address and Phone #___________________________ Job Title____________
-Additional Monthly income and source___________________________________

After doing the pre-screening I will contact the applicants who are likely to be approved to schedule a private showing.

Some of the Qualifications:
*Must be 18 years or over
*Must have at least $2200/Mo in verifiable household gross income
*Bring Photo ID to showing, also having proof of income at that time will expedite an application
*Be able to get WE Energies in your name
*Able to pay FULL Security deposit within a day of application approval
*No evictions in past 10 yrs.

Property is owned by a WI Licensed Real Estate Broker

Hello there. A little about me in brief: My name is Amanda; I’m an adventure junkie /professional nurse who travels back and forth. I'm originally from East Lansing, presently back in Boston for work, and it would be nice to find someone to sublease this beautiful place located in the heart of the city and move-in ready. This East Lansing Condo is a secured building with an intercom system! 1st-floor unit with a 2nd-floor feel as this beautiful one-bedroom unit overlooks a natural area off the private deck. Open floor plan on suite bathroom and laundry. There is no home tour available before moving in as you'd have to pick up the keys after the lease is signed, no credit check, and affordable monthly rent. Amenities include a clubhouse/lounge with library & fireplace, community room with kitchen, business center, and exercise facility. This unit also comes with a private carport parking spot. 

Please leave your contact details when inquiring. Thank you! Email me: amandameltzer98 (at) g.mail .com

$725,/ 2br - 600ft2 - ,Great 2 BR Apt,"
        
            QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Beautiful 2 BR first floor apt, big living room with a built-in air conditioner, re-decorated eat-in kitchen with refrigerator, stove and lots of cabinet space. Both bedrooms have double closets and hardwood floors. There is one assigned parking space included, shared porches and a storage locker and laundry in the basement. Close to Wauwatosa, major bus lines and easy access to downtown. Building has a history of good long-term tenants. Security deposit is $725. Available between Nov. 15 and Dec. 1st. Pictures are not the actual apt that will be available but are very similar to it. The biggest difference is the color of the appliances, instead of white, the stove is black and the refrigerator is stainless steel.

During the worst of COVID-19, I started doing pre-screening and private showings to limit everyone's exposure to it. I found this approach to be more effective and efficient than my old method of having an ""open house"" so I have decided to continue it even though COVID-19 is less of and issue than it was then. If you are reading this ad, the apt is still available. 
Please reply by email if you have more questions or are interested in providing the information I need to pre-screen. If you prefer to discuss the apt by phone you can call Jerry at 262-789-86twotwo, however, all pre-screen info needs to be given via email.

Info needed for pre-screen (you can copy this, hit ""reply"" above the ad title, then paste and fill it out in your email reply, please provide the info for each adult who will be residing at apt):

-Full name and birth date of each adult who will be residing at apt ________________________
-Name(s) and age(s) of child(ren) that will be living with you____________________________
-Current address________________________How long?_________Your phone #_____________
-Landlord name and contact info_________________________________________
-Current Employer_______________Starting date_______Gross Monthly Income______
Employer Address and Phone #___________________________ Job Title____________
-Additional Monthly income and source___________________________________

After doing the pre-screening I will contact the applicants who are likely to be approved to schedule a private showing.

Some of the Qualifications:
*Must be 18 years or over
*Must have at least $2200/Mo in verifiable household gross income
*Bring Photo ID to showing, also having proof of income at that time will expedite an application
*Be able to get WE Energies in your name
*Able to pay FULL Security deposit within a day of application approval
*No evictions in past 10 yrs.

Property is owned by a WI Licensed Real Estate Broker

            QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Now available, a unique 1 bedroom apartment with no neighbors - it’s the second floor of a century old carriage house (first floor is storage/laundry — a garage too small for most cars). 

Lots of natural light — tall windows on 3 sides of the unit. 
Privacy — the only buildings within 50 feet of you are garages, and the apartment is upstairs. 
Time saving - It’s a compact 400sf unit with ceramic tile in one half and bamboo laminate flooring in the rest. Easy to keep clean and allergy-friendly. 
Laundry at home — modern high efficiency washer and dryer installed within the last few years.
New refrigerator with built-in icemaker. 
Gas stove, microwave, and blender 
Air conditioned in summer.  

Free high speed wireless Internet. 
Water/sewer/trash included in rent — electricity and gas will be paid by tenant.  

Tenant must carry and maintain renter’s insurance.

Located two blocks from the river walk. Easy walk to Leeper Park. Less than a block to The Local Cup cafe. 

Credit and background check required — you’ll pay $30 to Rentspree for that.

1 year minimum lease.

The attached images are a bit dated — refrigerator and heating unit have both been replaced since they were taken. Please keep in mind that they are very wide angle photos to show the layout and appearance efficiently,  and (like almost all real estate photos) make the apartment look quite large. It is only 20 feet by 20 feet.  Cozy, not spacious. I have some current photos of the apartment empty available on request.

Note that the lower level (which is also about 400sf) is available for storage (we also store some things there) and use as additional space. The washer and dryer and water heater are located there. I’ve had tenants turn it into a study space.  The enclosed staircase and landing have also been used for that purpose during warmer weather, and offer additional storage space for items that are not sensitive to temperature changes. Both of these help to free up living space. 

The air conditioning unit is a portable AC (that is, a largish wheeled unit with a couple flexible hoses attached to an insulated panel that fits in a window. In winter, it is generally stored in the staircase closet space.
