👀🏡 Are you looking for a simple lease? 
Are you not quite ready to purchase now?🧐
Concerned about downpayment and interest rates? 
Would you like have rent stability and know exactly how much your rent payments will be each year through 5 years?😃
Would you like an option to purchase within the next 5 years (but without an obligation to purchase)? 🎉

My name is Wayne Hancock, and I am a REALTOR with Realty ONE Group Music City. My company is working with an amazing LEASE with a RIGHT TO PURCHASE program. If you qualify for our program, you get to pick a house that is FOR SALE based on your approved rent. My investment firm (Home Partners of America) will purchase the home, and you are only obligated to a 1 YEAR LEASE term at a time, with a right to renew your lease up to 5 years. You can purchase the home at anytime for a pre-agreed upon price, or simply treat this as a TRADITIONAL 12 MONTH LEASE! 

Basic Requirements to qualify:
• Annual household income of $50,000+
• Have a combined household credit score of 620+
• Stable employment
• Have no history of eviction or other landlord issues within past 3 years
• Have no pending bankruptcy
• Have no felonies within past 6 years
• Have no household members that are registered sex offenders
• Have no unsatisfied repossessions within the past 6 months
• Pets are welcome
• Have a deposit equal to twice your desired lease amount.

If you have a few minutes, reach out to me today and I can give you more information on the easy qualifications. I hope we can connect so help your housing search go more smoothly. I look forward to hearing from you!

(Due to our rapidly changing inventory, photos are from previous listings and are for example purposes only. We have LOTS of homes available all over Nashville Metro. Please note our lease program doesn’t accept section 8 vouchers.)

-Eliana from Gainesville, Virginia

""This my first AIRBNB. I was sort of nervous getting in a city I am not familiar with and using a self check-in lock box, but the instructions that Brandon sent over were very easy to utilize. Space was much more open and roomy than the pictures in the advert portrayed. I felt right at home. The house smelled wonderful and the linens and sheets were clean. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was hot. It was nice to be able to do laundry before I hit the road again. The apartment was a 10 min walk to all the great restaurants on Grand. There was even a marathon that went by the front door one of the days I stayed there. What an unexpected surprise story to tell my friends about my awesome trip. This will be my home away from home anytime I am in STL.""

A great deal in the most talked-about new building in St. Louis! I'm offering my apartment for December 1 to May 31 at a total savings of $3,030 to $5,430 from what you would pay for a six-month lease for any comparable unit with the Forest Park view that is now available through the building's Leasing Office. AND NO SECURITY DEPOSIT!!! Currently there is a long waiting list for reserved parking in the building's parking garage, but you can also assume my parking lease on a reserved garage space for $225 per month and avoid the wait list. The space is adjacent to the elevators that will take you directly to your front door. 

You'll be looking from the 33rd floor through 35 feet of floor-to-ceiling windows onto a spectacular 180+ degree view of Forest Park. The mansions of Westmoreland and Portland Place below to your right. The Art Museum, History Museum, Washington University and Clayton straight ahead. The Science Center And St Louis University to your left. Gorgeous sunset views, the changing of the seasons--and a great place to watch an incoming thunderstorm. And you will have the option of keeping the unit after the initial six months by signing a new lease through the building management. 

The unit is currently painted a warm, cozy color (Benjamin Moore ""Aztec Brick""), but will be repainted the building's standard white unless the new tenant asks to keep the current color. I have attached photos showing the current color. To see what it looks like white and vacant, view this link to a virtual tour of another unit that has the same floor plan, but is nine floors down from mine. The view from the higher elevation of my unit is much more dramatic.

This high-security building by the celebrated architect Jeanne Gang offers 24-hour reception, swimming pool, well-equipped workout room, game room, party room, indoor dog park and high-speed elevators. Garage parking available. Laundry in the unit. The Great Room and both bedrooms have the knock-out view of Forest Park. And a great CWE location!

Are you looking for a simple lease? 
Are you not quite ready to purchase now? 
Concerned about downpayment and interest rates? 
Would you like have rent stability and know exactly how much your rent payments will be each year through 5 years?
Would you like an option to purchase within the next 5 years (but without an obligation to purchase)? 

My name is Wayne Hancock, and I am a REALTOR with Realty ONE Group Music City. My company is working with an amazing LEASE with a RIGHT TO PURCHASE program. If you qualify for our program, you get to pick a house that is FOR SALE based on your approved rent. My investment firm (Home Partners of America) will purchase the home, and you are only obligated to a 1 YEAR LEASE term at a time, with a right to renew your lease up to 5 years. You can purchase the home at anytime for a pre-agreed upon price, or simply treat this as a TRADITIONAL 12 MONTH LEASE! 

If you have a few minutes, reach out to me today and I can give you more information on the easy qualifications. I hope we can connect so help your housing search go more smoothly. I look forward to hearing from you!

(Due to our rapidly changing inventory, photos are from previous listings and are for example purposes only. We have LOTS of homes available all over Nashville Metro. Please note our lease program doesn’t accept section 8 vouchers.)

This is not a listing of Re/Max Premiere Realty, but when you send me your information, I will email you an invite to the program where you can register and see this house and others.

* There also is another program which is more based on income, assets, and debt ratio vs. a credit score, and includes the entire St. Louis Metro area.

UTILIZE THIS PROGRAM TO LEASE AND/OR BUY IN THE FUTURE THIS  stunning 2 story home in the New Town subdivision! The 4 bed/2.5 bath home built in 2020 is beautifully maintained and ready for your arrival. Upon walking in, you are immediately greeted by the open concept throughout the main.

It’s a great option if you:
• Want to live in a single-family home, in a great community with quality schools
• Are a first-time homebuyer who’s cautious about buying a home now, but may want to buy in the future
• Are a home seeker in the process of relocating but aren’t sure where you want to settle down

Are you looking for a simple lease? 
Are you not quite ready to purchase now? 
Concerned about downpayment and interest rates? 
Would you like have rent stability and know exactly how much your rent payments will be each year through 5 years?
Would you like an option to purchase within the next 5 years (but without an obligation to purchase)? 

My name is Wayne Hancock, and I am a REALTOR with Realty ONE Group Music City. My company is working with an amazing LEASE with a RIGHT TO PURCHASE program. If you qualify for our program, you get to pick a house that is FOR SALE based on your approved rent. My investment firm (Home Partners of America) will purchase the home, and you are only obligated to a 1 YEAR LEASE term at a time, with a right to renew your lease up to 5 years. You can purchase the home at anytime for a pre-agreed upon price, or simply treat this as a TRADITIONAL 12 MONTH LEASE! 

If you have a few minutes, reach out to me today and I can give you more information on the easy qualifications. I hope we can connect so help your housing search go more smoothly. I look forward to hearing from you!

(Due to our rapidly changing inventory, photos are from previous listings and are for example purposes only. We have LOTS of homes available all over Nashville Metro. Please note our lease program doesn’t accept section 8 vouchers.)

This house was built in the mid-1950s, so it's aging but still has it's charm. The hardwood floors and stainless appliances make for a homey feel. If you're looking for a modern, brand new house, this won't be the right fit for you. If you're looking for a good location and something reasonably priced, this is the place for you! 

This house is centrally located between Belmont, Vanderbilt, Music Row, and the famous Honky Tonk Row. A 5 to 10-minute drive in any direction and you will find yourself in the best of Nashville's neighborhoods. It's only a half-mile from Hillsboro Village where you will find the brunch spot favorite - The Pancake Pantry! Osa coffee, Bella Napoli Pizzeria, Barcelona Wine Bar, Old Glory, and Jack Brown's burgers are just a couple of blocks away. It is a 10-minute car ride to Green Hills, home of the Bluebird Cafe, Trader Joe's, Whole Foods, and the upscale Green Hills Mall (Nordstrom, Burberry, Louis Vuitton.) Only 15-20 minute drive to Nashville international airport, depending on traffic.

Are you looking for a LEASE with a RIGHT TO PURCHASE? Or, are are you looking for a TRADITIONAL home lease (minimum of 12 month terms)? Are you looking for Transparency, Choices, Value, Control and Flexibility? 

• Transparency: Upon entering this program, you are given the monthly lease and purchase price information each year for up to five years*, so you can plan for the future. 
• Choices: Home Partners provides access to the MLS listings in the communities they serve, expanding your selection to all qualifying homes for sale. 
• Value: Home Partners uses our skill to purchase the home you want, providing you with an affordable lease and a pre-set purchase price each year for up to five years*. Also, there are no hidden fees or non-refundable deposits. 
• Control and flexibility: You have the right to purchase the home at any time during your residency, at the pre-set price. If the home value appreciates above this price each year and you choose to purchase it, you realize a financial benefit. If the value of the home declines, you can choose not to renew your lease and walk away without penalty. 

Basic Requirements to qualify:
• Annual household income of $50,000+
• Have a combined household credit score of 620+
• Stable employment
• Have no history of eviction or other landlord issues within past 3 years
• Have no pending bankruptcy
• Have no felonies within past 6 years
• Have no household members that are registered sex offenders
• Have no unsatisfied repossessions within the past 6 months
• Pets are welcome
• Have a deposit equal to twice your desired lease amount.

I have LOTS of homes available in the Nashville Metro area. Please visit my website to register and view our home inventory at: https://hancocksignaturehomes.com/lease. Be sure to look under the link “lease to own.”

Our lease program can be treated as a traditional lease (renewed every 12 months), or you can exercise your right to purchase your home after you become qualified for a mortgage (outside financing is required). After speaking with me, MANY of my clients have discovered they are actually qualified to purchase a home and are able to skip our lease to own program entirely.

This is also a great option for many people who are relocating to the Nashville Metro area and are unsure where they would like to buy a home. Our lease to own program allows you to walk away from your home (at the end of your lease term) and relocate to a different area of town that is more suitable with your current needs.

After checking out our website and available homes, I’m here to answer any questions that you might have and guide you along the way through the process of finding your new home. Feel free to call, text, or email me at anytime.

• Value: Home Partners uses our skill to purchase the home you want, providing you with an affordable lease and a pre-set purchase price each year for up to five years*. Also, there are no hidden fees or non-refundable deposits. 
• Control and flexibility: You have the right to purchase the home at any time during your residency, at the pre-set price. If the home value appreciates above this price each year and you choose to purchase it, you realize a financial benefit. If the value of the home declines, you can choose not to renew your lease and walk away without penalty. 

Basic Requirements to qualify:
• Annual household income of $50,000+
• Have a combined household credit score of 620+
• Stable employment
• Have no history of eviction or other landlord issues within past 3 years
• Have no pending bankruptcy
• Have no felonies within past 6 years
• Have no household members that are registered sex offenders
• Have no unsatisfied repossessions within the past 6 months
• Pets are welcome
• Have a deposit equal to twice your desired lease amount.

I have LOTS of homes available in the Nashville Metro area. Please visit my website to register and view our home inventory at: https://hancocksignaturehomes.com/lease. Be sure to look under the link “lease to own.”

Our lease program can be treated as a traditional lease (renewed every 12 months), or you can exercise your right to purchase your home after you become qualified for a mortgage (outside financing is required). After speaking with me, MANY of my clients have discovered they are actually qualified to purchase a home and are able to skip our lease to own program entirely.

This is also a great option for many people who are relocating to the Nashville Metro area and are unsure where they would like to buy a home. Our lease to own program allows you to walk away from your home (at the end of your lease term) and relocate to a different area of town that is more suitable with your current needs.

After checking out our website and available homes, I’m here to answer any questions that you might have and guide you along the way through the process of finding your new home. Feel free to call, text, or email me at anytime.

Are you not quite ready to purchase now? 
Concerned about downpayment and interest rates? 
Would you like an option to purchase within the next 5 years (but without an obligation to purchase)? 
Are you looking for a simple lease? 
Would you like have rent stability and know exactly how much your rent payments will be each year through 5 years?

My name is Wayne Hancock, and I am a REALTOR with Realty ONE Group Music City. My company is working with an amazing LEASE with a RIGHT TO PURCHASE program. If you qualify for our program, you get to pick a house that is FOR SALE based on your approved rent. My investment firm (Home Partners of America) will purchase the home, and you are only obligated to a 1 YEAR LEASE term at a time, with a right to renew your lease up to 5 years. You can purchase the home at anytime for a pre-agreed upon price, or simply treat this as a TRADITIONAL 12 MONTH LEASE! 

If you have a few minutes, reach out to me today and I can give you more information on the easy qualifications. I hope we can connect so help your housing search go more smoothly. I look forward to hearing from you!

(Due to our rapidly changing inventory, photos are from previous listings and are for example purposes only. We have LOTS of homes available all over Nashville Metro. Please note our lease program doesn’t accept section 8 vouchers.)

Are you not quite ready to purchase now? 
Concerned about downpayment and interest rates? 
Would you like an option to purchase within the next 5 years (but without an obligation to purchase)? 
Are you looking for a simple lease? 
Would you like have rent stability and know exactly how much your rent payments will be each year through 5 years?

My name is Wayne Hancock, and I am a REALTOR with Realty ONE Group Music City. My company is working with an amazing LEASE with a RIGHT TO PURCHASE program. If you qualify for our program, you get to pick a house that is FOR SALE based on your approved rent. My investment firm (Home Partners of America) will purchase the home, and you are only obligated to a 1 YEAR LEASE term at a time, with a right to renew your lease up to 5 years. You can purchase the home at anytime for a pre-agreed upon price, or simply treat this as a TRADITIONAL 12 MONTH LEASE! 

If you have a few minutes, reach out to me today and I can give you more information on the easy qualifications. I hope we can connect so help your housing search go more smoothly. I look forward to hearing from you!

(Due to our rapidly changing inventory, photos are from previous listings and are for example purposes only. We have LOTS of homes available all over Nashville Metro. Please note our lease program doesn’t accept section 8 vouchers.)

Beautiful home on large lot in the center of White House will be available for rent approximately 11/1. This house backs right up to White House city park (nature trail), and is nestled in a spacious and private neighborhood right off of hwy 76 (less than 1 minute to sonic).

Here are the details: we will be renting out the home as it is now (3 bed 2 bath) for 1950/mo. However, once the basement is finished (in a couple months) the full rent will jump to 3460. Whether that is you having extended family move in, your friends, or roommates you find from school or work- you , the person on the lease, will be responsible for the full amount. This could also be an opportunity for you to make some extra money from the house you are living in- rent is 3460… anything you make above that from charging for rooms etc will be your business! 
All utilities to be in tenants name and paid by tenant. 1950 security deposit, first months rent, and full lease agreement signed before moving in. Pets are allowed with a non refundable deposit of $400 and a $30/mo per pet rent fee.

Would you like an option to purchase within the next 5 years (but without an obligation to purchase)? 
Are you looking for a simple lease? 
Would you like have rent stability and know exactly how much your rent payments will be each year through 5 years?

My name is Wayne Hancock, and I am a REALTOR with Realty ONE Group Music City. My company is working with an amazing LEASE with a RIGHT TO PURCHASE program. If you qualify for our program, you get to pick a house that is FOR SALE based on your approved rent.

You can purchase the home at anytime for a pre-agreed upon price, or simply treat this as a TRADITIONAL 12 MONTH LEASE! 

If you have a few minutes, reach out to me today and I can give you more information on the easy qualifications. I hope we can connect so help your housing search go more smoothly. I look forward to hearing from you!
