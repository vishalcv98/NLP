            QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Now available, a unique 1 bedroom apartment with no neighbors - it’s the second floor of a century old carriage house (first floor is storage/laundry — a garage too small for most cars). 

Lots of natural light — tall windows on 3 sides of the unit. 
Privacy — the only buildings within 50 feet of you are garages, and the apartment is upstairs. 
Time saving - It’s a compact 400sf unit with ceramic tile in one half and bamboo laminate flooring in the rest. Easy to keep clean and allergy-friendly. 
Laundry at home — modern high efficiency washer and dryer installed within the last few years.
New refrigerator with built-in icemaker. 
Gas stove, microwave, and blender 
Air conditioned in summer.  

Free high speed wireless Internet. 
Water/sewer/trash included in rent — electricity and gas will be paid by tenant.  

Tenant must carry and maintain renter’s insurance.

Located two blocks from the river walk. Easy walk to Leeper Park. Less than a block to The Local Cup cafe. 

Credit and background check required — you’ll pay $30 to Rentspree for that.

1 year minimum lease. 
$500 security deposit
$600 per month
Pets will be considered on a case by case basis and will require additional deposit and fees.


The attached images are a bit dated — refrigerator and heating unit have both been replaced since they were taken. Please keep in mind that they are very wide angle photos to show the layout and appearance efficiently,  and (like almost all real estate photos) make the apartment look quite large. It is only 20 feet by 20 feet.  Cozy, not spacious. I have some current photos of the apartment empty available on request.

Note that the lower level (which is also about 400sf) is available for storage (we also store some things there) and use as additional space. The washer and dryer and water heater are located there. I’ve had tenants turn it into a study space.  The enclosed staircase and landing have also been used for that purpose during warmer weather, and offer additional storage space for items that are not sensitive to temperature changes. Both of these help to free up living space. 

The air conditioning unit is a portable AC (that is, a largish wheeled unit with a couple flexible hoses attached to an insulated panel that fits in a window. In winter, it is generally stored in the staircase closet space.

Best for work-from-home! Cozy, updated 2 bed/1 bath house in Nashville's popular Woodbine neighborhood! Close to downtown, fairgrounds and more! Hardwood floors, updated washer & dryer in-unit, newer water heater and central air/heat! Little built-in dishwasher, perfect for a quaint space. All appliances stay (good, working condition). Perfect for newlywed couple or small family. NO smoking. NO cats. Small dogs under 20 lbs considered with additional pet deposit (house-trained only). Spacious backyard. Note: Bedroom closets are small, but there's space in both rooms to add an armoire. There are also train tracks that close off the cal-de-sac on an irregular schedule; hence work-from-home, remote work or a flexible schedule is best!

I have an apartment that I am trying to sublet at the Clubhouse due to a relocation at my job. The lease will end in July unless you decide to resign. It is a short walk to UofL campus and is fully furnished! I pay $450 a month with free garage parking. The only other fee is if you have an animal and then you have to pay for electric which usually runs between $0-40. It just depends on how much you and your roommates use for the month. You will also have 3 roommates which are all girls, so I am looking for a girl to sublet. see pictures and message me for more details:)

7-month room sublease (Dec 1st, 2022-- June 30th, 2023), with the option to stay month by month afterwards, by Missouri Botanical Garden. Price $465 per month. 

We (three grad students) are looking for one roommate who would like to occupy one bedroom, starting from Dec 1st, 2022. This is because one of our roommates is leaving at the end of Nov. Our address is 4448 Shaw Blvd. E., St. Louis, MO 63110. It's a four-bedroom, two-floored townhouse with a nice backyard, one block from the botanical garden. We welcome anyone interested, especially students/scholars. 

The room itself is on the first floor, and comes with its own spacious porch facing the backyard. Wood floors, zero carpet in the room. 

Super safe neighborhood, nice to walk to the beautiful Missouri Botanical Garden and the tower grove park. PLUS, you can get into the botanical garden at any time if you are a garden student. Close to the Hill Italian neighborhood, The Grove, and Manchester Ave, for plenty of bars and restaurants.

Grill and firepit for share in backyard. 
Central heat and central AC.
In-unit laundry is available. 
The BIG garden backyard is a bonus, you can plant whatever you want  
Utilities are not included in the price shown.
Public transport: Two of our roommates usually bike to washu in the summer. The closest metro is Central west end. There is a bus going to the metro right in front of our house (see last picture).

Before you decide to stay at Woodspring Suites, we want you to be prepared--prepared for a better experience.  What that means to us is a truly affordable, incredibly clean, safer, simple, flexible experience.  And this is more than just a nice idea --it's the Woodspring Suites promise.  So how do we do it?  By combining all the convenience of a hotel with all the essentials of an apartment.  We are a hybrid--and that makes us better than a hotel, an apartment or any other short-term housing accommodations you’ll find.  Think about it—no extras padded into our price, no hidden fees.   No lease to sign, no utilities to set up.  That’s just for starters.  Find out below more of what to expect when you’re here.
