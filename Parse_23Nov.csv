The booking rate you see below covers all utilities and even includes complementary Netflix-no need to waste your time setting up services, we've got you covered.

☆☆Brick+Oak Highlights☆☆

☆The Central West End ☆ One of the Nation's Top 10 Neighborhoods ☆

The neighborhood is absolutely incredible and exceptionally walkable.  Forest Park, considered one of the nation's greatest urban public parks, is just down the street.  Looking for upscale dining or a cozy coffeehouse?  A great bookshop or contemporary boutique?  World-class art gallery or live music?  You'll find it all here, nestled among eye-catching public artwork and stunning turn-of-the-century homes.  Come see why the American Planning Association named the Central West End one of the nation’s top 10 neighborhoods.

☆Bedrooms☆

Each of the 3 stunning bedrooms are illuminated with Edison lighting over exposed brick walls and feature the artwork of the Dutch post-impressionist Vincent Van Gogh.  Each bedroom is equipped with a comfortable high-end queen bed with high-quality, 100% cotton sheets.

The kitchen comes chef-ready, with pots and pans, dishes, glasses, utensils, and basic condiments like salt, pepper, and oil provided free of charge.  We also provide our guests with an assortment of complimentary teas, coffee, and purified Brita water.

Should you require an additional bed, the sofa swiftly and easily converts to a queen bed, and we provide the linens.  The living room is also equipped with a 50"" flat screen, 4K Smart TV with complimentary Netflix.

The two newly remodeled bathrooms feature tiled walls with premium stainless fixtures and granite countertops.  The bathroom is stocked with complimentary, high-quality, all-natural artisan shampoo, conditioner, body wash, and hand soap from Beekman 1802.

""Brandon's place is stunning! From the well appointed decor to the linens, everything is in place and labeled so there is no confusion. Everything works well, is sparkling clean and comfortable. The location is just a short walk away from many eateries and shops and it's only a short drive or Uber to the Arch and downtown. Brandon is a top notch host and is super helpful if you need anything during your stay. If you're coming to St Louis, I highly recommend you consider Brandon's place, you won't regret it!""

-Johnny from Cookeville, Tennessee

""First time staying at an Airbnb and the check-in and check-out process was easy to follow. Brandon provided great instructions. Great location, very clean, and spacious apartment.""

-Eliana from Gainesville, Virginia

""This my first AIRBNB. I was sort of nervous getting in a city I am not familiar with and using a self check-in lock box, but the instructions that Brandon sent over were very easy to utilize. Space was much more open and roomy than the pictures in the advert portrayed. I felt right at home. The house smelled wonderful and the linens and sheets were clean. The bed was very comfortable and the shower was hot. It was nice to be able to do laundry before I hit the road again. The apartment was a 10 min walk to all the great restaurants on Grand. There was even a marathon that went by the front door one of the days I stayed there. What an unexpected surprise story to tell my friends about my awesome trip. This will be my home away from home anytime I am in STL.""

-Sean from Kansas City, Kansas

""We stayed at Brandon’s place twice and it was great both times. Very clean in a great location. We’d stay there again!""

-Rachel from San Francisco, California

""This was my first time using Airbnb and without a doubt Brandon made it a outstanding experience. I will be using him for all my trips to St. Louis""

-Matthew from Perryville, Missouri

""Check in was super easy and the parking spot was very convenient. If I found myself in Saint Louis again I would for sure stay at Brandon’s place again.""

-Caleigh from Chicago, Illinois

""Surprised the placed looked just as nice as the photos!! Everything worked great and about 5-10 minutes from a lot of things to do""

Brian from Tampa, Florida

""The location was very central to everything we needed. We were a group of 5 with two dogs and this place accommodated us perfectly. Quiet with many safety features. Brandon is an outstanding host, he was very quick to respond and very personable. All in all our stay was excellent!""

-Lisa from Kansas City, Missouri

""The place was very clean has great value. Good location and close (no more than 15 minutes) to everything in town.""

-Jonathon from Tampa, Florida

""Super easy to check in & out, spotlessly clean, and cozy. Would stay here again!""

-Haley from Chicago, Illinois

""Great spot. Brandon’s apartment is is spacious,stylish and comfortable. What more could you want ? Food? There are two restaurants well within walking distances. You’ll also find a few local markets and a grocer equally as close. The night life is a short drive/Uber away. An amazing historical park for you and your fur baby to walk at the end of the street. I also appreciated Brandon being mindful of my work schedule when he checked in. Amazing host!""

The oversized private balcony balcony is a huge perk of this unit and the boutique hotel-style pool and fitness center doesn't hurt either. Plus theater, game room, huge dog run, outdoor running track, and a short walk to literally EVERYTHING!

Top of the line in-unit washer/dryer and modern stainless steel appliances. This is a GREAT setup for roommates due to the split and separated design.

            QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
A great deal in the most talked-about new building in St. Louis! I'm offering my apartment for December 1 to May 31 at a total savings of $3,030 to $5,430 from what you would pay for a six-month lease for any comparable unit with the Forest Park view that is now available through the building's Leasing Office. AND NO SECURITY DEPOSIT!!! Currently there is a long waiting list for reserved parking in the building's parking garage, but you can also assume my parking lease on a reserved garage space for $225 per month and avoid the wait list. The space is adjacent to the elevators that will take you directly to your front door. 

You'll be looking from the 33rd floor through 35 feet of floor-to-ceiling windows onto a spectacular 180+ degree view of Forest Park. The mansions of Westmoreland and Portland Place below to your right. The Art Museum, History Museum, Washington University and Clayton straight ahead. The Science Center And St Louis University to your left. Gorgeous sunset views, the changing of the seasons--and a great place to watch an incoming thunderstorm. And you will have the option of keeping the unit after the initial six months by signing a new lease through the building management. 

The unit is currently painted a warm, cozy color (Benjamin Moore ""Aztec Brick""), but will be repainted the building's standard white unless the new tenant asks to keep the current color. I have attached photos showing the current color. To see what it looks like white and vacant, view this link to a virtual tour of another unit that has the same floor plan, but is nine floors down from mine. The view from the higher elevation of my unit is much more dramatic.

https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=r6sWZUtwFDa&brand=0

This high-security building by the celebrated architect Jeanne Gang offers 24-hour reception, swimming pool, well-equipped workout room, game room, party room, indoor dog park and high-speed elevators. Garage parking available. Laundry in the unit. The Great Room and both bedrooms have the knock-out view of Forest Park. And a great CWE location!

Spacious and sunny living room facing a quiet tree-lined Wicker Park street. Kitchen has been recently updated with white quartz counters and custom backsplash. Kitchen island can be used as a workspace. 

Master bedroom has a queen size bed and a private master bathroom. Large closet and a desk. This room gets a lot of sun throughout the day and it has a sliding door to get in and out of the patio. 

Second bedroom is currently an office with a futon (sleeps 2 people). It faces the other condo building therefore it doesn’t get as much light. It has a nice size closet and a bathroom next to it. 

Patio is private with a small grill and patio furniture. In the winter we keep the patio furniture in storage.

Heart of Bucktown/Wicker Park, updated 2 bedrooms, 2 bathroom condo...  The kitchen boasts updated appliances, an island counter, and breakfast bar. The bathrooms are all updated, and the master bathroom is equipped with a jetted tub and separate steam shower.  The unit is also equipped with a 55 inch Samsung smart TV, in-unit washer/dryer, and wine fridge. Water, gas, electricity, xfinity cable, and wifi high speed internet is included.  There is a private roof top deck with a grill and eating area with skyline views.

There is an available garage parking space for $200 per month.  

I'm looking for short or long term renters who need a space that is fully furnished and equipped. The neighborhood is well known for it's proximity to the blue line train, restaurants and nightlife, but it is very much a neighborhood.

I'm open to short term arrangements.  This is ideal for renters who do not want to deal with moving furniture into a space.  Get in touch if you have questions.  I'm flexible as far as terms go.

Please no agents unless you have a client that is looking for this type of space.  I do not need a listing agent.

Hello and thank you for looking at our wonderful home we have for sale.

THIS HOME IS LOCATED IN STITZER,WI.

This home is a 3 bedroom, 1 bath home that is approximately 1044 sq'. Great starter home, even though it is a bit dirty and in need of some work.

One of the best parts of this home is that we are selling it with OWNER FINANCING for 64,900. This is not a lease purchase or rent to own where you pay for years and own nothing, but a REAL owner financing where the buyer gets the deed and ownership at closing. We are looking for a reasonable down payment and income history to do the loan for the new owner. This home won't last long!

FAQ's

1. Do I own the home? Do we have a closing?
We close at a local title company, and you get the deed. You own the home. We take back the note just like the bank.

2. What if I want to make changes to the home?
You own the home. All we care about is the payment being made, so feel free to make any changes to the home that you like.

3. What is the rate and down payment?
Down payment and rate depend on income but getting 15-20k down is not uncommon. Sometimes we get more. We can do a 10-, 20-, or 30-year term on the loan. No balloons and no pre-payment penalties.

4. I'm interested in this home, and I have a reasonable down payment. How do I view?
Email us and we can set you up to view the home.

Springing up in 2020 along the rapidly-growing Milwaukee Avenue corridor in River West, this newly constructed apartment complex is designed with luxury aesthetics to create an exceptional living environment. Premium quality amenities abound including a cinema lounge with 85” flat-screen, rooftop party room with demo kitchen, grills, and alfresco dining, state-of-the-art fitness center, business center and co-working pods, and an outdoor sun deck with a resort-style pool. The unit stylings reflect the industrial and artistic character found throughout the River West neighborhood with a mix of brick and graffiti murals along with creative high-end furnishings and accessories.

These chic apartments have a mix of exposed loft-style elements along with modern elegant touches.  Each unit is outfitted with luxury finishes including plank wood flooring, stainless steel appliances, quartz countertops, marbled tile back splash, deep soaking tub, walk-in closets, floor-to-ceiling windows, Nest thermostat, full size in-unit washer and dryer and gas stove.  Select units also include balconies and double sink vanities.

River West is a quieter micro neighborhood that straddles the northwest tip of downtown Chicago and the eastern entrance to the greater West Town cluster of neighborhoods.  Location, location, location is the key appeal to River West, as it is surrounded by other popular neighborhoods including River North, Fulton Market, West Loop, Ukrainian Village and Wicker Park.  It is extremely convenient for commuters being about 10 minutes from the Loop via CTA Blue Line train, 66 Chicago and 56 Milwaukee bus routes, the ""Hipster Highway"" protected bike lanes on Milwaukee Ave, or car. CTA Blue line train station and bus stops are a 1 block walk from your front door.  Drivers will also love that access to I-94 is right across the street for northbound destinations, and the southbound ramp is also less than 5 minutes away.

Enjoy a quick stroll to local eateries such as Windy City Cafe, Pie-Eyed Pizza, D'Agostino's, Twisted Spoke, Opart Thai House, Piccolo Sogno, Maillard Tavern, and The Dawson. Grabbing a cup of joe could not be easier with Big Shoulders Coffee and Dunkin Donuts just around the corner. The beloved neighborhood watering hole is right next door at The Matchbox, and it is one of the most unique in the city as it may be the smallest bar in Chicago, but there is plenty of outdoor seating along side an actual vintage train car.  Wandering down Chicago Ave, Milwaukee Ave. or Grand Ave. you'll stumble upon art galleries, independent boutique shops, craft brew pubs, wine bars and diverse cuisine throughout the neighborhood that make River West a cozy pocket of Chicago with lots of character. Daily essentials are also close by at CVS, Jewel-Osco, and BWS Beverage.

Convenient services accommodate your daily needs on-site too including a front desk concierge, 24-hour maintenance and property management, package service, and a coffee bar.  Parking garage is available with additional fees. Cats and dogs are welcome (with some restrictions) with a dog run and pet washing station on site to keep your fur babies active and clean.

Lovely newer construction in River West. Modern finishes with all hardwood floors. Balcony, tons of closet space, very close to 94 and CTA Blue line and 66 &56 busses!

Just call or email text with the following info, and I'll be happy to help, thanks!

When is your move date? (is it flexible, if so how far in either direction)?
Any pets (weight and breed)?

When are you available for a showing?

Springing up in 2020 along the rapidly-growing Milwaukee Avenue corridor in River West, this newly constructed apartment complex is designed with luxury aesthetics to create an exceptional living environment. Premium quality amenities abound including a cinema lounge with 85” flat-screen, rooftop party room with demo kitchen, grills, and alfresco dining, state-of-the-art fitness center, business center and co-working pods, and an outdoor sun deck with a resort-style pool. The unit stylings reflect the industrial and artistic character found throughout the River West neighborhood with a mix of brick and graffiti murals along with creative high-end furnishings and accessories.

These chic apartments have a mix of exposed loft-style elements along with modern elegant touches.  Each unit is outfitted with luxury finishes including plank wood flooring, stainless steel appliances, quartz countertops, marbled tile back splash, deep soaking tub, walk-in closets, floor-to-ceiling windows, Nest thermostat, full size in-unit washer and dryer and gas stove.  Select units also include balconies and double sink vanities.

River West is a quieter micro neighborhood that straddles the northwest tip of downtown Chicago and the eastern entrance to the greater West Town cluster of neighborhoods.  Location, location, location is the key appeal to River West, as it is surrounded by other popular neighborhoods including River North, Fulton Market, West Loop, Ukrainian Village and Wicker Park.  It is extremely convenient for commuters being about 10 minutes from the Loop via CTA Blue Line train, 66 Chicago and 56 Milwaukee bus routes, the ""Hipster Highway"" protected bike lanes on Milwaukee Ave, or car. CTA Blue line train station and bus stops are a 1 block walk from your front door.  Drivers will also love that access to I-94 is right across the street for northbound destinations, and the southbound ramp is also less than 5 minutes away.

Enjoy a quick stroll to local eateries such as Windy City Cafe, Pie-Eyed Pizza, D'Agostino's, Twisted Spoke, Opart Thai House, Piccolo Sogno, Maillard Tavern, and The Dawson. Grabbing a cup of joe could not be easier with Big Shoulders Coffee and Dunkin Donuts just around the corner. The beloved neighborhood watering hole is right next door at The Matchbox, and it is one of the most unique in the city as it may be the smallest bar in Chicago, but there is plenty of outdoor seating along side an actual vintage train car.  Wandering down Chicago Ave, Milwaukee Ave. or Grand Ave. you'll stumble upon art galleries, independent boutique shops, craft brew pubs, wine bars and diverse cuisine throughout the neighborhood that make River West a cozy pocket of Chicago with lots of character. Daily essentials are also close by at CVS, Jewel-Osco, and BWS Beverage.

Convenient services accommodate your daily needs on-site too including a front desk concierge, 24-hour maintenance and property management, package service, and a coffee bar.  Parking garage is available with additional fees. Cats and dogs are welcome (with some restrictions) with a dog run and pet washing station on site to keep your fur babies active and clean.

Enter your home with a quick wave of a fob. Floor-to-ceiling windows and 9'-high, exposed concrete ceilings lend an airy feeling to living spaces; custom solar shades add privacy. What's most important to you: a dining room table ... or work space? The large in-line kitchen, maxed out on storage and design flexibility, leaves you room for choice. 

Besides a place to lay your head, it's also where you work, work out, and relax. Separate business and home life with glassed-in work spaces and conference table. Stay healthy in the fitness studio, outfitted with on-demand video workouts, a smartphone tracker for treadmill availability, and towel service. A nearby lounge featuring a demonstration kitchen with communal seating, and wine storage let you go out -- when you'd rather just stay in. 

For a showing Call/Text My service is free. Contact me at any time.

Be the first to live in the unit! Brand spanking new in west loop! Great amenities and pricing for a 13 or 14 month lease!
Parking additional at $325 in private garage.

Overlooking a huge historic city park, this luxury apartment complex is on the western edge of the popular West Loop neighborhood. It is close enough to all of the action, amazing Randolph Street restaurants and downtown businesses, while having a little bit of cushion from the hustle and bustle, and a lot more green breathing room.

Steeped in luxury finishes, these apartments feature wood plank flooring throughout, quartz countertops, artistic custom backsplashes, soft close cabinetry with under-lighting, glass walk-in showers, and stainless-steel appliances. You’ll also get a Nest thermostat and keyless entry system, which come standard. 
This property didn’t skimp on the amenities, either. If you’re a fitness fanatic, this is the building for you. It has a state-of-the art fitness that boasts Technogym equipment. Enjoy Chicago’s steamy summers in the oversized pool or lounging in the cabanas. The rooftop courtyard has tons of seating, plus grilling stations. There’s also an entertainment lounge and game room. If you work from home, you’ll be covered in the co-working space that was designed with individual stations and private conference rooms.

Cats and dogs are welcome with breed restrictions. There’s an on-site dog run and pet spa, but you’ll also have the added pet perk with over 13 acres of green space at the park right across the street. Garage parking is available with additional fees

Properties like this are one of the main reasons more people than ever are calling the South Loop home. This smart, unique mid-rise combines the best of modern buildings with the traditional warmth and feel of a loft-style space. Situated in the heart of Printer’s Row, it offers incredible access to transportation, with walking access to every CTA train in less than 10 minutes and just a few blocks’ drive to the 90/94 and 290 Expressways. Stroll to endless shopping, including Target and Whole Foods, restaurants such as Umai, Blackie’s and Hackney’s and tons of boutique shops and bars. Stay on-site and enjoy the sundeck and outdoor pool, full-service fitness center with private yoga studio, and multiple lounge areas for TV, billiards, cooking or business. There’s even outdoor grilling stations and fire pits. This 100% smoke-free building is also a LEED Silver & ENERGY STAR® Certified community and has a 24-hour security door staff.

It’s hard to enter these apartment homes and not be drawn to the 10’ ceilings with exposed concrete and duct work. Kitchens include stainless steel appliances with either slate gray or espresso cabinets and designer backsplashes. Hardwood flooring, resident-controlled and programmable thermostats and full-size stackable washers and dryers come standard in every apartment. Some units come with exposed brick and balconies, as well.

Parking is available on-site at an additional charge and there is permit street parking within walking distance. Cats are accepted throughout and dogs are welcome on select floors (dog breed and weight restrictions apply). They have a private dog run as well.

I have a furnished 3-bedroom/2-bathroom duplex-down unit at my 2-flat walk-up available for rent starting mid-December. The rent is $3,400 and includes...

- Fully furnished living room and dining room
- Large, spacious kitchen with all kitchen essentials, large and small kitchen appliances including a refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, coffee maker, blender, toaster, etc. I can store all small electrics away if you have your own. 
- Utilities Included! FREE high-speed Wi-Fi, water, as well as Netflix and select other services (HBO Max, Paramount+) (livestream gaming that uses large amounts of bandwidth is an upcharge)
- Bedrooms all come with closets, nightstands, lamps and full-size beds with hidden drawers for storage. The master bedroom also has a dresser and huge walk-in closet. Master bedroom has ensuite bathroom shared with one bedroom. Garden bedroom has private bathroom with its own living space, wet bar, microwave and mini-fridge
- FREE LAUNDRY facilities in the unit in the basement with top-of-the-line large-capacity front-loading washer and dryer
- Newly installed backyard fence and deck

The Neighborhood:
There are LOTS of great restaurants, coffee shops, bars, stores, music venues, parks and other attractions in the neighborhood. Bustling and trendy Wicker Park and Bucktown is a 10-minute walk or just 1 stop on the Blue line. Walking distance to 2 grocery stores (Fresh Market and Aldi).

Getting Around:
There is free parking on the streets nearby or you can get parking stickers from the city to park on the street. Western, Armitage and Milwaukee buses are right by the house or the Western blue line stop is less than 5 minutes away. Five stops on the Blue line will take you to the loop for business or recreation in about 15 minutes. Besides the train, there are buses that can help take you anywhere you need. And of course, there are also taxis and Ubers galore.

I can send you a video tour first. If still interested, I can then arrange an in-person viewing. Please note that this unit is located in a 2-unit building, which means please be respectful of your noise levels since others live in the building.

With its prism-like façade this new 24-story glass apartment tower reflects the increasing trend of luxury high-rise living in the South Loop. Located in the McCormick Square micro-neighborhood, renters of the 275 units here are near the sprawling McCormick Place Convention Center, Illinois Institute of Technology, and DePaul University’s Wintrust Arena.
 
Zip to the Loop in 10 minutes from the CTA Green Line Cermak-McCormick Place station just 1 block away. Drivers also have convenient access to Lake Shore Drive, I-55 and I-90 expressways.  
 
There’s plenty to do around the neighborhood along Cermak Road, as well as adjacent Motor Row, Chinatown, Pilsen and Bronzeville with a growing surge of restaurants, brewery pubs, and entertainment venues. Culture and recreation are also nearby at the Museum Campus, Soldier Field, Northerly Island and the Lakefront Trail.
 
Live a lush life for less with amenities that rival other downtown high-end apartments, but at a more attainable price point compared to other Loop-adjacent neighborhoods such as West Loop, River North and Streeterville. Residents here can enjoy 25,000 square feet of amenity space including a fully-equipped fitness center, yoga studio with virtual trainer, private work spaces, conference room, club lounge with pub room, game/arcade room, sports simulator room, outdoor pool deck with fire pits, grilling stations and private cabanas. Convenient on-site services are also available including dry cleaning lockers, package receiving room, a guest suite, and bike storage.
 
Inside these apartments the warm earth tones welcome you to a soothing home environment. The uniquely styled kitchen finishes feature a mix of hues with European two-tone white and beige cabinetry, marbled light quartz countertops, gray tile backsplash and stainless steel appliances. Elements of on-trend exposed concrete ceilings and wide plank wood flooring also create a modern loft look. The floor-to-ceiling windows provide brilliant unobstructed views in all directions. Each unit also includes full-size washers and dryers, premium roller shades and keyless entry. 
 
A private parking garage is available on-site for an additional monthly fee. Cats and dogs are welcome (dog breed and weight restrictions apply), and there is an on-site outdoor dog run for your fuzzy buddy too!

Springing up in 2020 along the rapidly-growing Milwaukee Avenue corridor in River West, this newly constructed apartment complex is designed with luxury aesthetics to create an exceptional living environment. Premium quality amenities abound including a cinema lounge with 85” flat-screen, rooftop party room with demo kitchen, grills, and alfresco dining, state-of-the-art fitness center, business center and co-working pods, and an outdoor sun deck with a resort-style pool. The unit stylings reflect the industrial and artistic character found throughout the River West neighborhood with a mix of brick and graffiti murals along with creative high-end furnishings and accessories.

These chic apartments have a mix of exposed loft-style elements along with modern elegant touches.  Each unit is outfitted with luxury finishes including plank wood flooring, stainless steel appliances, quartz countertops, marbled tile back splash, deep soaking tub, walk-in closets, floor-to-ceiling windows, Nest thermostat, full size in-unit washer and dryer and gas stove.  Select units also include balconies and double sink vanities.

River West is a quieter micro neighborhood that straddles the northwest tip of downtown Chicago and the eastern entrance to the greater West Town cluster of neighborhoods.  Location, location, location is the key appeal to River West, as it is surrounded by other popular neighborhoods including River North, Fulton Market, West Loop, Ukrainian Village and Wicker Park.  It is extremely convenient for commuters being about 10 minutes from the Loop via CTA Blue Line train, 66 Chicago and 56 Milwaukee bus routes, the ""Hipster Highway"" protected bike lanes on Milwaukee Ave, or car. CTA Blue line train station and bus stops are a 1 block walk from your front door.  Drivers will also love that access to I-94 is right across the street for northbound destinations, and the southbound ramp is also less than 5 minutes away.

Enjoy a quick stroll to local eateries such as Windy City Cafe, Pie-Eyed Pizza, D'Agostino's, Twisted Spoke, Opart Thai House, Piccolo Sogno, Maillard Tavern, and The Dawson. Grabbing a cup of joe could not be easier with Big Shoulders Coffee and Dunkin Donuts just around the corner. The beloved neighborhood watering hole is right next door at The Matchbox, and it is one of the most unique in the city as it may be the smallest bar in Chicago, but there is plenty of outdoor seating along side an actual vintage train car.  Wandering down Chicago Ave, Milwaukee Ave. or Grand Ave. you'll stumble upon art galleries, independent boutique shops, craft brew pubs, wine bars and diverse cuisine throughout the neighborhood that make River West a cozy pocket of Chicago with lots of character. Daily essentials are also close by at CVS, Jewel-Osco, and BWS Beverage.

Convenient services accommodate your daily needs on-site too including a front desk concierge, 24-hour maintenance and property management, package service, and a coffee bar.  Parking garage is available with additional fees. Cats and dogs are welcome (with some restrictions) with a dog run and pet washing station on site to keep your fur babies active and clean.

The description for this home is in the second paragraph, but for clarity, this is a rent/lease option program. You are allowed to stay up to 5 years, but only have to agree to a one year lease. You may purchase the home at anytime, if you so choose. This is a 45-60 day process once we have secured the home you chose. Our office has conducted over 80 transactions with this investment firm, so if you are NOT working with an agent, please contact me with your name and email address, and or phone number, and I will email you an invite to the program so you can navigate, and see if this program is for you. This is not a listing of Re/Max Premiere Realty, but when you send me your information, I will email you an invite to the program where you can register and see this house and others.

* There also is another program which is more based on income, assets, and debt ratio vs. a credit score, and includes the entire St. Louis Metro area.

UTILIZE THIS PROGRAM TO LEASE AND/OR BUY IN THE FUTURE THIS Much larger than it looks! Absolutely darling 1.5 story brick home nestled on picturesque Julian Place. All the charm but full of updates for todays busy lifestyle. Kitchen was remodeled & gained more square footage in '18 by adding to the back of the home to provide the new buyer with the ultimate kitchen that gives the open concept living to the dining room. 42"" white cabinets, gorgeous quartz countertops, stainless steel appliances to include gas 5 burner range, microwave, dishwasher and refrigerator. Belly up to the peninsula bar and enjoy the views out the kitchen window to the fenced backyard, patio and garage. Hardwood floors flow in the entire first floor. Inviting sun-filled living room features a gas fireplace with mantle. Main floor primary bedroom is living large 14x12. Both bathrooms have been updated. Upstairs are 2 nice size bedrooms, walk-in closet, 2nd bath & loft area perfect for a play room/office. Finished rec room in the lower level.

It’s a great option if you:
• Want to live in a single-family home, in a great community with quality schools
• Are a first-time homebuyer who’s cautious about buying a home now, but may want to buy in the future
• Are a home seeker in the process of relocating but aren’t sure where you want to settle down
• Can’t obtain a mortgage right now
Contact me today for more information and details about the program

An expansive roof deck overlooks Pilsen with grills, multiple seating options, as well as an indoor kitchenette. The building was the historical location of an Otis elevator company factory.

Part of the lower west side of Chicago, Pilsen has long been associated with immigrant groups to the city who have defined its culture. It is known for street art such as murals connected to Mayan and Aztec cultures which have influenced Mexican artists which can be seen along the Metra tracks and as a part of the 18th Street Pink Line CTA station. Bars and restaurants on 18th Street, as well as the renovated Thalia Hall music venue, offer plenty of nightlife and entertainment.

When is your move date?(is it flexible, if so how far in either direction)?
Any pets(weight and breed)?
Need parking?
Budget(just rent)?
What is your preferred neighborhood(s)?
Have you toured any properties yet?(so that I don't double up on my research)
When are you available for a showing?

When it comes to blending the work hard/play hard lifestyle, few properties do a better job than this one. With easy expressway access for commuters, and a straight shot into The Loop, getting to work is a breeze. For stay-at-home workers, you’ll find a neighborhood vibe only minutes outside of the downtown scene. In either case, this “we-thought-of-everything” building offers world-class amenities, starting with their 360-degree rooftop pool deck that covers more than a half acre! Lounge seating, private grilling stations and a fire pit are all part of the experience. There is also an outdoor yoga studio. Moving indoors, you’ll find a full fitness center, resident party room, game room with billiards table and technology lounge with complimentary coffee bar. The building is 100% smoke-free and has a 24-hour door staff.

These apartment homes are urban living at its finest. Expect to find floor-to-ceiling windows, wide plank flooring, full-size washers and dryers and gourmet kitchens. No details were spared with the white quartz countertops, mosaic tile backsplashes and quiet close cabinetry. All of this, plus oversized closets and resident-controlled heat and air conditioning. Some units have balconies.

Parking is available on-site at an additional charge. Cats and dogs are accepted throughout and there is a dog run for your four-legged friend (dog breed restrictions apply, but there is no weight limit).

Excellent, beautiful condo in Pilsen-right off Ashland. Conveniently located one block south of 18th St. 

This is a 6 unit building in a very desirable neighborhood. 

This condo boasts 2500 square feet! All freshly painted with hardwood floors on the main floor and comfy carpet downstairs. 5 bedrooms gives you space to work at home, entertain family and friends for extended time. Kitchen is newly remodeled with white cabinets, quartz countertops, a new microwave and a Bosch dishwasher. Filtered water dispenser included, and a beautiful farm sink makes for a chef's dream. 

In unit laundry as well as a workout room enhance the list of desirable amenities. The living room and the family room both have fireplaces for the snowy winter nights. 

The convenience of living in a duplex condo with plenty of space and still having the proximity of the highlights of Pilsen cannot be beat.

Public transportation is very easy to access. 18th Street is a step away and allows you to walk to excellent restaurants, ice cream, coffee shops, the library and cute boutiques. The lake and downtown are within a 10 min. drive and easy to bike to as well. 

Security Deposit $3000

This recent addition to the River North neighborhood has set the bar for high-rise living extremely high! You’ll know you’re at a next level type of property from the moment you enter the impressive lobby. A vast array of amenities includes a media theater with surround sound, a state-of-the-art fitness center with sauna and steam room, a gorgeous outdoor pool deck with grills, and much more. For those times when you must venture off-site for work or play, you’re looking at a short walk to the CTA Brown, Purple and Red Lines and just about a minute in the car to hop on I 90/94. Walk to some of the city’s most popular nightlife spots just a couple of blocks to the east, and then return home to your slightly quieter corner of River North. There is 24-hour door staff to welcome you to this 100% smoke-free property.

Upon entering these apartments, you’ll notice efficient floor plans with generous closet space and high ceilings. Hardwood flooring is standard in the living spaces (the bedrooms are carpeted) and each unit has a washer and dryer. Kitchens boast quartz countertops with a glass and stone backsplash along with designer Italian cabinetry. Last but not least, this building has a 4-pipe heating and cooling system, meaning that you can individually run your heat or AC on demand (regardless of season).

Parking is available on-site at an additional charge. Cats are accepted throughout and dogs are welcome on almost every floor (dog breed restrictions apply). There is a dog run on-site, and you’ll find a larger dog park just two blocks away.

Springing up in 2020 along the rapidly-growing Milwaukee Avenue corridor in River West, this newly constructed apartment complex is designed with luxury aesthetics to create an exceptional living environment. Premium quality amenities abound including a cinema lounge with 85” flat-screen, rooftop party room with demo kitchen, grills, and alfresco dining, state-of-the-art fitness center, business center and co-working pods, and an outdoor sun deck with a resort-style pool. The unit stylings reflect the industrial and artistic character found throughout the River West neighborhood with a mix of brick and graffiti murals along with creative high-end furnishings and accessories.

These chic apartments have a mix of exposed loft-style elements along with modern elegant touches.  Each unit is outfitted with luxury finishes including plank wood flooring, stainless steel appliances, quartz countertops, marbled tile back splash, deep soaking tub, walk-in closets, floor-to-ceiling windows, Nest thermostat, full size in-unit washer and dryer and gas stove.  Select units also include balconies and double sink vanities.

River West is a quieter micro neighborhood that straddles the northwest tip of downtown Chicago and the eastern entrance to the greater West Town cluster of neighborhoods.  Location, location, location is the key appeal to River West, as it is surrounded by other popular neighborhoods including River North, Fulton Market, West Loop, Ukrainian Village and Wicker Park.  It is extremely convenient for commuters being about 10 minutes from the Loop via CTA Blue Line train, 66 Chicago and 56 Milwaukee bus routes, the ""Hipster Highway"" protected bike lanes on Milwaukee Ave, or car. CTA Blue line train station and bus stops are a 1 block walk from your front door.  Drivers will also love that access to I-94 is right across the street for northbound destinations, and the southbound ramp is also less than 5 minutes away.

Enjoy a quick stroll to local eateries such as Windy City Cafe, Pie-Eyed Pizza, D'Agostino's, Twisted Spoke, Opart Thai House, Piccolo Sogno, Maillard Tavern, and The Dawson. Grabbing a cup of joe could not be easier with Big Shoulders Coffee and Dunkin Donuts just around the corner. The beloved neighborhood watering hole is right next door at The Matchbox, and it is one of the most unique in the city as it may be the smallest bar in Chicago, but there is plenty of outdoor seating along side an actual vintage train car.  Wandering down Chicago Ave, Milwaukee Ave. or Grand Ave. you'll stumble upon art galleries, independent boutique shops, craft brew pubs, wine bars and diverse cuisine throughout the neighborhood that make River West a cozy pocket of Chicago with lots of character. Daily essentials are also close by at CVS, Jewel-Osco, and BWS Beverage.

Convenient services accommodate your daily needs on-site too including a front desk concierge, 24-hour maintenance and property management, package service, and a coffee bar.  Parking garage is available with additional fees. Cats and dogs are welcome (with some restrictions) with a dog run and pet washing station on site to keep your fur babies active and clean.

"$1,200,000",/ 1br - ,Brandan Burger,"

Please beware of your new landlord and insure you have contingencies in place for your family if you pass away while you are renting from Brandan Burger. This landlord will claim all your property and help himself to all your possessions stating that you abandoned it because your dead. Your family will then need to obtain a lawyer just to get back a limited number of items after Brandan Burger has sold, kept, or thrown away what he wants. 
His last tenant passed away April 2nd and after four months we finally have whatever Brandan Burger deemed acceptable to him to return. However, he provided zero explanation to what happened to all the tenant’s belongings. Shockingly apparently his last tenant did not own any bed to sleep on, no pots/pans/dishes/silverware, zero shirts, jeans, socks, underwear, shoes, towels, bedding (guess if no bed you do not need that) or normal every household necessities. You get the point I am making. 
We tried to accommodate Brandan Burger to remove the property and clean, however after driving 3 hours one way Brandan Burger determined that weekend just would not work for him. He advised that we could pick up a small tote of personal things like the tenant’s mail, medicine, and part our ways because Brandan Burger said everything else, he now owned. 
Brandan Burger maliciously caused additional pain, stress, and hardship to our family with zero legal justification or cause. Brandan Burger is a prime example of what is wrong with today’s society. The only thing Brandan Burger accomplished was a twisted boost to his small man complex. Brandan Burger is the scum of Middleton WI.
People reading this should be appalled by Brandan Burgers actions and hopefully treat him the way he deserves. I wish Brandan Burger a horrible existence, may all terrible things he has caused/done to others come back on Brandan Burger tenfold.

Opening available in a Freeport indepedent group home, a host home, for an intellectually disabled adult person. Must be Medicaid waiver approved and on the PUNS list. A host home is a more private, 2 person group home for those who are able to be more active in the community and in need of more personal attention and supervision, rather than being placed in a large group home. Licenced by DHS State of Illinois. If you know of an individual turned away by other agencies due to no openings available, this may be your answer. The Host Home program in Illinois is relatively new, and allows an intellectually disabled adult more freedom, daily outings, to possibly have a pet, and have more say in their meal choices, and top quality food provided. I am licensed with a four year degree and many years experience in caring for individuals. Beautiful home on a half-acre near Krape Park.
