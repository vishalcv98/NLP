Beautiful 2 BR first floor apt, big living room with a built-in air conditioner, re-decorated eat-in kitchen with refrigerator, stove and lots of cabinet space. Both bedrooms have double closets and hardwood floors. There is one assigned parking space included, shared porches and a storage locker and laundry in the basement. Close to Wauwatosa, major bus lines and easy access to downtown. Building has a history of good long-term tenants. Security deposit is $725. Available between Nov. 15 and Dec. 1st. Pictures are not the actual apt that will be available but are very similar to it. The biggest difference is the color of the appliances, instead of white, the stove is black and the refrigerator is stainless steel.

During the worst of COVID-19, I started doing pre-screening and private showings to limit everyone's exposure to it. I found this approach to be more effective and efficient than my old method of having an ""open house"" so I have decided to continue it even though COVID-19 is less of and issue than it was then. If you are reading this ad, the apt is still available. 
Please reply by email if you have more questions or are interested in providing the information I need to pre-screen. If you prefer to discuss the apt by phone you can call Jerry at 262-789-86twotwo, however, all pre-screen info needs to be given via email.

Info needed for pre-screen (you can copy this, hit ""reply"" above the ad title, then paste and fill it out in your email reply, please provide the info for each adult who will be residing at apt):

-Full name and birth date of each adult who will be residing at apt ________________________
-Name(s) and age(s) of child(ren) that will be living with you____________________________
-Current address________________________How long?_________Your phone #_____________
-Landlord name and contact info_________________________________________
-Current Employer_______________Starting date_______Gross Monthly Income______
Employer Address and Phone #___________________________ Job Title____________
-Additional Monthly income and source___________________________________

After doing the pre-screening I will contact the applicants who are likely to be approved to schedule a private showing.

Some of the Qualifications:
*Must be 18 years or over
*Must have at least $2200/Mo in verifiable household gross income
*Bring Photo ID to showing, also having proof of income at that time will expedite an application
*Be able to get WE Energies in your name
*Able to pay FULL Security deposit within a day of application approval
*No evictions in past 10 yrs.

Property is owned by a WI Licensed Real Estate Broker

No problem with background check, credit check or drug tests. Responsible and reliable.Hello! I'm a thirtysomething trans (she/her), who is in an urgent housing situation and looking for a safe/quiet room back in Northampton.
My budget is ideally around $500-600, but I have guaranteed income, so that is flexible.

I lived in NoHo for a bit until recently, when I trusted the wrong stranger from a housing group and moved about a half hour away, right into an increasingly unsafe situation.
The landlord offered to let me out of the lease with 30 days notice since they're aware. I would move before that (if poss) but still pay them my obligations.

I have a beautiful tuxedo kitty (my emotional support animal) named Paul. I can provide documentation for his ESA status if necessary. He has always stayed with me in my room & is kept clean, with an air purifier next to his litterbox. He's my only family & I'd never abandon him.

I'm respectful of space & others, am always genuine, fairly quiet, and practice good hygiene. My passions are creative typically, so I spend a lot of time writing & making art. I plan to go back to social work again, but it's been very difficult without any stability as of the past few months. I am vaxxed/boosted.

I have never felt as safe and accepted in my life as I have in NoHo, ever, and being trans, that means the literal world to me. I just want to be back home. Please feel free to message, and thank you!I'm looking for a reasonably affordable room to rent, I'm a 38 year old , my occupation is a traveling private health care provider.

Excellent references available. I can afford up to $600 including utilities.Short term (?) room needed for mature, flexible & personable professional moving back to NY

Please no brokers / middle-persons / otherwise fee generating services/companies.

Single (straight) Black , mid 50’s, **no drama**, **super** quiet and **fastidiously** clean (drugs & disease free (*very* rarely drinks)), *non-smoker*, *very* personable former I.T. Project Manager (that needed a break from I.T.) is moving back to NY after being a live-in companion/attendant for a special needs (cerebral palsy, manic depression, bi-polar disorder, ADHD, high-functioning autism) young adult outside of NY state. This live-in arrangement is ending at the end of November 2022.

I am moving back to NY alone. I am fully COVID-19 vaccinated (Moderna). I have no problem wearing masks if necessary. I fully & strongly believe in consideration of others as well as their space.

As I am out of state, I’d hoped effective communication and video walk-throughs would help overcome the logistical challenges. I hope you agree. Real/serious inquiries only - I have experienced the """"Craigslist effect"""" far too often during this search - so if I am exceedingly wary, I hope you understand.

I am *initially* looking for a short term/low-cost room rental starting November 30/December 1 2022, until I can find a more permanent arrangement (I will only have a backpack (or perhaps a small duffel) and possibly a small suitcase). If this arrangement benefits both parties and you are amenable to it being more than a short-term arrangement, I am *very* open to this possibility.
I will not look a gift horse in the mouth if a dynamic possibility should present itself! :)
I am also *very* open to work exchange (I am a diligent and hard worker).I have lived at my present residence for 20 plus years. Landlords have changed and not for the good. The previous two were awesome! I do have two well trained cats 12 years old that I would need to take! I have a real reasonable rate on my rent since I have been here for so long! I pay my own utilities, and garbage. Preferably would need two to three small bedrooms. I do work f/t in Malta, NY, my wife works also! I do have a medical condition I'm willing to discuss at the right opportunity!

Willing to discuss what I am currently paying & willing to pay now!!! Must be a clean area and quiet, that's how my wife and i like it!30-year-old Trans student early in their transition looking for a safe, comfortable and accepting environment. I'm open to living with both sexes, men preferable as legally I still am one, but we can discuss, of similar age and interests. It's no longer best for me to stay where I'm at currently, I live alone for the past 10 years, but looking to form better relationships and not feel as lonely or stressed both personally and financially.

I'm kind, clean, dependable and creative
I love all kinds of music and movies and TV shows
I enjoy conversation on a variety of topics, politics is fine with me
I like to cook
I love to eat LOL
Love walking on hikes or the beach

Full disclosure, i do have a housing voucher and am currently looking to increase my streams of income ASAP, I'm willing to discuss this more in detail as i make potential matches with folks. But wanted to be upfront as i am also ready to move on from benefits.

I'm open to a house share
I'm hoping over time to have a cat or dog, i hope this will be acceptable
In need of housing as winter approaches-
I am a young 21yr old mother to a four yr old boy I homeschool and am currently pregnant by my 24yr old boyfriend;
He has worked for ARC full time and I have security & have a few months forward of rent with DSS assistance, we have no animals, we don’t smoke, and we were hoping to rent a two bedroom but anything is worth it-
We could afford to pay up to $1,000/mo
and I was hoping if any kind landlord has availability to please consider working with our family on getting a rental apartment/home.
Much appreciation for you reading this; blessingsI am looking for an appt (or sublet) for a single person, 45 y.o.w. . Clean, quiet, respectful, responsible. A large studio (or 1 bedroom). Large loft with high ceilings and lots of windows on two sides would be ideal (up to $2200 with electricity included). Don't care much about kitchen (a fridge and a microwave is all I need). Don't care much about bathroom either. Don't need furniture. It would be nice to have a couch and a bed but nothing else (I will decorate the place myself). Looking for a year lease. Have a guarantor. Must be cat friendly. Upper West Side is the best. UES or around central Park is fine. Higher than first floor. Balcony is a big plus. Need the place by December or mid January.
Thank you.
With Mettã.Hello! I'm looking to do a housing swap in New York or New Jersey for my room in my spacious Los Angeles apartment. My intended dates are Nov 23 - December 23rd. I live in a two bedroom on Melrose hill (koreatown / hollywood border) with my roomie/brother. The place is extremely central, 10-15 minutes to Silverlake, Echo Park, West Hollywood, Sunset blvd and we are right on top of the hill so our balcony has the view of the Hollywood sign, Griffith Park and surrounding areas.
You'd be living with Ignacio (28) and our cat, Renoir. He will be home for the first three weeks of December, then going home for the holidays around the 22nd. Open to talking about exact dates. Our house is our sanctuary so ideally we can become great friends and we'll care for each other's house as if it were our own. I'm looking for a place in New York that has a somewhat easy path to get to Montclair, New Jersey or somewhere in New Jersey with the same idea as I will be working on a film shooting in Montclair every weekday starting at 6 am. Please holler/ share if this sounds like we complete each other's wishes. :)Stop sending me nasty emails, im not interested in anything other than finding a rental.
Single mom of 2 small in search of an affordable 1 to 2 bedroom rental. Posting again in hopes that someone will help us out. I have a full time job, good credit and no evictions on my record. I have a pet bird that I would be moving with as well. We will take a shack, a bungalow, a small trailer, anything at this point. I take care of my on my own with no financial help from their dad and im trying really hard to pull myself onto my own two feet.
I would prefer to stay in orange county but im willing to travel to Sullivan or ulster.
Please let me know if you have something or know of something available. Im ideally looking for a rental no more than $1,200 a month. Thank you.Mature carpenter looking for room to rent with kitchen priviliges and off street parking. I'm looking for a room to rent for a month or 2 possibly more. I'm a 30 year member of the Connecticut Carpenters Union currently working on a job in the area. I'm from Connecticut but now reside in Maine near Sunday River Ski Resort. The job I am on now will go at least until the end of the year. Possibly longer. I am a non smoker and allergic to pets so the home would have to be pet & smoke free. Some cats I am ok with. I have been a caretaker & managed rental property myself. I can also do work & chores for a deduction or in exchange for rent. I look forward to hearing from you.

Adorable bungalow on the near east side. You'll love the charm and character of this home beginning as you step through the enclosed front porch and into the light-filled living room, with hardwood floors throughout the main level. Just through the  arched doorway is a lovely updated kitchen with newer cabinets, marble countertops and stainless appliances. Rounding out the main level is a bedroom/office/playroom and a full bath. Upstairs you'll find 2 additional bedrooms. Head down to the lower level where there's additional finished space, currently used as an office and TV room. Step out from the back porch into your fenced backyard with an abundance of perennials, berry patches & more.

Beautiful 2 BR first floor apt, big living room with a built-in air conditioner, re-decorated eat-in kitchen with refrigerator, stove and lots of cabinet space. Both bedrooms have double closets and hardwood floors. There is one assigned parking space included, shared porches and a storage locker and laundry in the basement. Close to Wauwatosa, major bus lines and easy access to downtown. Building has a history of good long-term tenants. Security deposit is $725. Available between Nov. 15 and Dec. 1st. Pictures are not the actual apt that will be available but are very similar to it. The biggest difference is the color of the appliances, instead of white, the stove is black and the refrigerator is stainless steel.

During the worst of COVID-19, I started doing pre-screening and private showings to limit everyone's exposure to it. I found this approach to be more effective and efficient than my old method of having an ""open house"" so I have decided to continue it even though COVID-19 is less of and issue than it was then. If you are reading this ad, the apt is still available.
Please reply by email if you have more questions or are interested in providing the information I need to pre-screen. If you prefer to discuss the apt by phone you can call Jerry at 262-789-86twotwo, however, all pre-screen info needs to be given via email.

Info needed for pre-screen (you can copy this, hit ""reply"" above the ad title, then paste and fill it out in your email reply, please provide the info for each adult who will be residing at apt):

-Full name and birth date of each adult who will be residing at apt ________________________
-Name(s) and age(s) of child(ren) that will be living with you____________________________
-Current address________________________How long?_________Your phone #_____________
-Landlord name and contact info_________________________________________
-Current Employer_______________Starting date_______Gross Monthly Income______
Employer Address and Phone #___________________________ Job Title____________
-Additional Monthly income and source___________________________________

After doing the pre-screening I will contact the applicants who are likely to be approved to schedule a private showing.

Some of the Qualifications:
*Must be 18 years or over
*Must have at least $2200/Mo in verifiable household gross income
*Bring Photo ID to showing, also having proof of income at that time will expedite an application
*Be able to get WE Energies in your name
*Able to pay FULL Security deposit within a day of application approval
*No evictions in past 10 yrs.

Property is owned by a WI Licensed Real Estate Broker

You would be moving into this gorgeous apartment with stunning windows in downtown Clayton, walkable to countless bars and restaurants. I have a locked in lower rate from pre-covid times that is currently almost $400 a month less than the same layout with a similar reserved parking space on the first parking level. I've loved living here, just got another job in another city (and will be taking all of my furniture with me)! 

This is a 651 sq ft apartment with new finishes, stunning windows, a fabulous rooftop pool and lounge area, and package services and key fob entry in the front lobby and elevators. Washer/dryer unit included, as is shower/tub and three closets! This would entail taking over a lease that will expire in early July for you to renew then if interested. It totals $1874 a month, which includes a reserved parking spot for $95, internet/cable hookup for $90 and combined water and other utilities (besides electric) for $40.

It's also not far at all from the metrolink, WashU or any number of other fun spots in the CWE or downtown! Peel pizza also delivers straight to your own apartment or the roof. There is a one-time $500 fee paid to me to cover cleaning costs before you move in. Please reach out if you would like to schedule a viewing.

This is a spacious SUNNY one-bedroom apartment. I am subletting until the lease expires at the and of May, so you would have the option to extend the lease if you wanted to stay. I can be flexible at the end of Dec about move in dates.

I am willing to negotiate about leaving some of the furnishings/paint on the wall/AC unit, but mostly the apartment will be unfurnished.

Electricity, gas and wifi are separate. There is laundry and bike storage in the basement of the building. The building is pet friendly.

You'd be renting with a leasing company. They are very good about responding to maintenance issues/other issues. They are convenient and easy to work with. They charge $60 for maintenance fees. They also require a $50 background check for sub-letter, and that you have renter's insurance.

The neighborhood is great. One block from 53rd. 1-ish mile from UChicago

"$1,200",/ 2br - 800ft2 - ,Thrifty Bungalow,"
        
            QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
BROAD RIPPLE. The Greenwich Village of Indianapolis! Are you looking for an upscale lifestyle on a shoe-string budget? Here's a small, economical, two-bedroom bungalow only a few minutes away from the popular Indianapolis northside dining and entertainment district -- an area that is holding up admirably during the post-pandemic. 

The Thrifty Bungalow is a petite Eisenhower-era house, almost seventy years old, with a big yard, front and back, and space on all sides. Passthrough street traffic is light, and the neighbors are both friendly and respectful of privacy.

CONVENIENT. It's just a block west off Keystone at 69th Street, in a quiet. tree-lined neighborhood. It offers all the advantages of urban living and convenient shopping, with Broad Ripple's attractive stores, restaurants, and night clubs right around the corner.

AMENITIES. This was a solid, G.I.-loan-type house built back in the 1950s, and it's been carefully preserved ever since. The floors are hardwood, and the bathroom is tiled. It has also been updated, with new HVAC and gas furnace installed in 2018, and a new water heater added in the same year.

ACCOMMODATING. 800 square feet of floor space. Refinished kitchen cabinets, refinished sliding windows, electric range & refrigerator. Shelving in utility room, bathroom cabinets. Wired for cable-TV and broadband. Recently installed washer and dryer. The house is smoke-free and has been so for many years.

COMFORTABLE. Living room, kitchen, one bath, two bedrooms, utility porch. One linen closet, one coat closet, one clothes closet in each of the two bedrooms. Built-in bookshelf. Detached one-car garage with storage space and automatic overhead door. Paved driveway. Large, level back yard.

LOW MAINTENANCE. During renovation a few years ago, the landlord installed attic insulation, crawlspace insulation, new storm windows, new breaker box, new wiring, new gas lines. It all adds up to incredibly low utility bills year-round, and a trouble-free, day-to-day lifestyle.

GETTING AROUND. By car, eight minutes to Broad Ripple Park and Library, ten minutes to Broad Ripple Village, half an hour to downtown Indy and IUPUI. A few blocks either way on Keystone and you'll find Kroger, Wal-Mart, Sullivan's Hardware, Dairy Queen, McDonald's, Glendale Shopping Center, Lowe's, Meijer, Aldi, and dozens of budget and upscale restaurants.

ABOUT PETS. One cat OK. A small dog (10 pounds or less) will be considered, but will require extra fees and/or additional security deposit, depending on breed, size, age, weight, temperament, etc. The back yard is fenced only on the east side.

REASONABLE TERMS. Now available for only $1,200, due on the first of each month. Tenant agrees to sign a 12-month lease and to pay all utilities. The smoke-free requirement is not negotiable. One month's rent and equivalent one-month security deposit (total of $2,400) will be required in advance before the move-in.

OPTIONAL LAWN CARE. The tenant will coordinate with the city's weekly trash collectors and keep the property free of debris. Tenant is also responsible for mowing grass and any weeds, but a fee for alternative professional lawn care may be added to the deal.

APPLICATION AND LEASE. A printed application will be distributed to any interested party. If the application is accepted, the Lease/Rental Agreement must be agreed to and signed, and the security deposit and the first month's rent must have been received and successfully deposited by the landlord. Copies of the application and the Lease can be transmitted via e-mail.

CHECK IT OUT! It's the perfect place for a couple, or for a single professional needing to work from home and requiring office space. If you are looking for an alternative to cramped, noisy apartment existence & parking-space hassles, and you really want to find a thrifty, energy-efficient house, in a handy neighborhood, this is the place for you!

AVAILABILITY! Ready for immediate occupancy by 1 December 2022.

LIKE TO HAVE A LOOK? We recommend that you drive by the house, look it over, and check out the neighborhood, too. Get in touch with us via Craigslist, and we'll send you the address. If the outside looks OK, please let us know via Craigslist. We can arrange to show the interior almost any weekday or weekend afternoon. We will send you a cell-phone number, and between us we will set up an appointment.

Our historic, renovated 7 bedroom/3 bath multi-family home in Indianapolis Holly neighborhood is going to be available for rent.

BACKYARD - The house has an amazing backyard that you and your fur friends will love. We did a whole lot of pandemic gardening and grilling and socially distanced hosting here. There is also a storage shed.

LOCATION LOCATION - The house is within 5-10 minute walking distance of incredible coffee shops, bars, and restaurants such as Greater Goods, Kemuri Tatsuya, La BBQ, Vegan Nom, La Holly, Blue Owl Brewing, Juan in a Million, Suerte, Lazarus Brewing, Canje…and I really could go on and on.

And my favorite fact about our house is that it is less than a 0.5 mile away from the incredible Lady Bird hike/walk/run nature trail.

OTHER DETAILS - new A/C system, Washer-Dryer in unit, Gas Stove with oven, Dishwasher unit all included in the rent. The bathrooms were also recently remodeled. Located just 20 minutes outside of Downtown indianapolis, St. Johns is surrounded by Highway 290, Highway 183, and I-35, making it perfect for commuters. There are plenty of chain restaurants that serve the area, but for a greater variety of offerings just cross the I-35 to Highland and indulge in the options along North N Richardt Ave.


The place is in great shape and such a special home. Contact us  show contact info

Our address is 4448 Shaw Blvd. E., St. Louis, MO 63110. It's a four-bedroom, two-floored townhouse with a nice backyard, one block from the botanical garden. We welcome anyone interested, especially students/scholars. 

The room itself is on the first floor, and comes with its own spacious porch facing the backyard. Wood floors, zero carpet in the room. 

Super safe neighborhood, nice to walk to the beautiful Missouri Botanical Garden and the tower grove park. PLUS, you can get into the botanical garden at any time if you are a garden student. Close to the Hill Italian neighborhood, The Grove, and Manchester Ave, for plenty of bars and restaurants.

Grill and firepit for share in backyard. 
Central heat and central AC.
In-unit laundry is available. 
The BIG garden backyard is a bonus, you can plant whatever you want  
Utilities are not included in the price shown.
Public transport: Two of our roommates usually bike to washu in the summer. The closest metro is Central west end. There is a bus going to the metro right in front of our house (see last picture).

If interested, please contact  for more information.

My father and I are looking to rent this cozy 2 bedroom home on a ""medium term"" (30 days or more) as we continue to upgrade the property between tenants and use it personally. This early 20th century home is ideal for traveling workers, students, or new Madison arrivals that need a place to stay while gathering their bearings. We are not some rigid slumlord company and have a family style approach to our small enterprise - thus we're happy to entertain any requests. The entire two bedroom house is available for rent - sorry, but we're not offering single bedrooms for rent. The price listed includes AT&T Fiber internet; however, the gas and water bill is not included in the price.

The house is a fully furnished, freshly renovated and tastefully decorated single family home located in a lovely lakeside neighborhood. It has a slow paced feel to it, yet it is very centrally located within walking and biking distance to everything Madison has to offer! Some highlights include: 65"" 4K HDTV w/ Apple TV, Amazon FireStick and local channels in the living room; 500 mb/s AT&T fiber internet; washer and dryer in basement; a few older but functional bicycles; free off-street parking, and finally my passion for exceptional hospitality :-) I used to Airbnb this property and had Superhost status for 4 years and an average rating of 4.94 at this property before we switched to ""medium term"" rentals. Feel free to text or email me and we can arrange a time to get on a call!

Thanks for looking!

P.s. If you are reading this, a lease has not yet been finalized - I always take my postings down right away once I strike a deal :)

Light and bright, this two-story coach house cottage faces on a courtyard garden and is a perfect  romantic getaway right in the city. Upstairs is an airy 400-square-foot space with a cathedral ceiling, lighting inset into beams and oak floors laid on the diagonal. The kitchen, in one corner, features a 1963 Chambers stove and counter seating. A sliding glass door on the side opens onto a huge deck, while two sliding doors in front open onto a smaller balcony. The bedroom, also with oak floors, is downstairs and has closets across the back wall. Adjacent is a tiled bathroom and dressing area. The apartment has its own furnace; ask about heat and electric costs. 

Just minutes from the Mag Mile by bus (which stops on the corner) or bike, the neighborhood has gotten super trendy. Right around the corner on Chicago Avenue are nifty boutiques, two upscale wine shops, and close to a dozen restaurants, among them Noble Thai, Opart Thai, Jeong and Flo. Noble Square’s other attractions--all within walking distance--range from  Frontier on Milwaukee Ave. to Green Grocer, Bari Foods, D’Amato’s, Tempesta, and Coalfire on Grand Ave. The apartment also is across Noble St. from Eckhart Park, which has an indoor swimming pool. 

If you're looking for quirky charm, this is the place for you. If central air, in-unit laundry, and a dishwasher are deal-breakers, don't bother to apply.

If there’s ever a problem, the owner lives right next door.

This cream city brick building was built in 1900 by the Schlitz brewery as a dance hall & saloon.  Prohibition prompted its conversion to 1920’s era apartments.  The available 2 bedroom unit is on the second floor.  The apartment features natural light, a dining room, clawfoot tub with shower, ample closets, high ceilings and hardwood floors.  

The building provides a quiet environment and offers coin laundry, basement lockable storage and a shared back yard with a raised bed garden for your use.  

The Urban Ecology Center, free tennis courts and running track are directly across the street, as are access to the Oak Leaf bike trail, community garden plots, Riverside Park and the Rotary Arboretum.  The Riverside Milwaukee Recreation site is across the playing fields, offering inexpensive art, fitness and other classes and a pool.  The East Side is a highly walkable neighborhood with great restaurants, theaters, the East Library and shopping.  The building is near bus lines and a bike share station.  

Responsive local landlords live 4 blocks away.

Rent is $1260 per month including heat (steam radiators) and water.  Tenant pays for electricity and cooking gas.
Lease through July 31, 2023 with security deposit of $1,275.  Tenant can inquire about renewing with a 1-year lease beginning August 1, 2023.
A garage parking space is available for an additional $85/month.

No smoking

We can't accept applicants with past citations for behaviors disturbing to neighbors (noise violations, underage drinking, disorderly conduct, etc.) or histories of nonpayment.

Feel free to e-mail with questions or to request a showing - masks required during in-person showings.  Must pass background and credit checks before lease is offered. ($39 per person paid online).

Please beware - there is a scam in which real ads are copied by a scammer who puts his or her own e-mail in place of the original poster’s contact information.  If photos are not provided or the rent is less than $1260, you are likely seeing this scam.  We will always ask to meet you in person and will not ask for your unencrypted e-mail address until after we have met.  Never make a payment for this rental until after you have met us.

Our community is conveniently located by Bronson Battle Creek, KCC, and Irving Park. Close to shopping, downtown shops, and the library, there is no shortage of places to go, within walking distance. Walk the trails of beautiful Irving park, or go downtown to see the sights.

Our community offers spacious floor plans with 2 or 3 bedrooms. Choose either a lower unit with a patio, or an upper unit with a balcony. All units have ground floor, private entrances, so those in a 2nd level unit don't have to worry about carrying groceries up icy stairs. There are 2 full bathrooms in every unit, as well as a full size washer and dryer, at no additional monthly cost.

Currently we have no open units, but you are welcome to get on the wait list at no cost. Please contact the office for details. At this time we are not offering tours.

Let us get you into your new home.

21-home SFR portfolio scattered about in Montgomery, AL. There are eleven 2-bedroom, eight 3-bedroom, and two 4-bedroom homes. The average asking price per home of $57,142 is significantly below the average home sales price of $248,793 (April 2022) in Montgomery, AL according to Culverhouse College of Business. The seller purchased the homes one at a time over the past decade. Upon acquisition, the seller deployed the necessary capital to improve the homes. Improvements include kitchen and bath remodels, roofs and repairs, new HVAC units where needed, as well as cosmetic alterations during tenant turns. The homes are 100% occupied. Gross rents are a little over $14,000 a month. Many of the tenants have been in place for more than two years. The portfolio is self-managed providing an investor the opportunity to employ a professional management company to improve operational efficiencies. Another immediate value-add opportunity is raising rents on the month to-month tenants.

$725,/ 2br - 600ft2 - ,Great 2 BR Apt,"
        
            QR Code Link to This Post
            
        
Beautiful 2 BR first floor apt, big living room with a built-in air conditioner, re-decorated eat-in kitchen with refrigerator, stove and lots of cabinet space. Both bedrooms have double closets and hardwood floors. There is one assigned parking space included, shared porches and a storage locker and laundry in the basement. Close to Wauwatosa, major bus lines and easy access to downtown. Building has a history of good long-term tenants. Security deposit is $725. Available between Nov. 15 and Dec. 1st. Pictures are not the actual apt that will be available but are very similar to it. The biggest difference is the color of the appliances, instead of white, the stove is black and the refrigerator is stainless steel.

During the worst of COVID-19, I started doing pre-screening and private showings to limit everyone's exposure to it. I found this approach to be more effective and efficient than my old method of having an ""open house"" so I have decided to continue it even though COVID-19 is less of and issue than it was then. If you are reading this ad, the apt is still available.
Please reply by email if you have more questions or are interested in providing the information I need to pre-screen. If you prefer to discuss the apt by phone you can call Jerry at 262-789-86twotwo, however, all pre-screen info needs to be given via email.

Info needed for pre-screen (you can copy this, hit ""reply"" above the ad title, then paste and fill it out in your email reply, please provide the info for each adult who will be residing at apt):

-Full name and birth date of each adult who will be residing at apt ________________________
-Name(s) and age(s) of child(ren) that will be living with you____________________________
-Current address________________________How long?_________Your phone #_____________
-Landlord name and contact info_________________________________________
-Current Employer_______________Starting date_______Gross Monthly Income______
Employer Address and Phone #___________________________ Job Title____________
-Additional Monthly income and source___________________________________

After doing the pre-screening I will contact the applicants who are likely to be approved to schedule a private showing.

Some of the Qualifications:
*Must be 18 years or over
*Must have at least $2200/Mo in verifiable household gross income
*Bring Photo ID to showing, also having proof of income at that time will expedite an application
*Be able to get WE Energies in your name
*Able to pay FULL Security deposit within a day of application approval
*No evictions in past 10 yrs.

Property is owned by a WI Licensed Real Estate Broker

Our historic, renovated 7 bedroom/3 bath multi-family home in Indianapolis Holly neighborhood is going to be available for rent starting November 1.

BACKYARD - The house has an amazing backyard that you and your fur friends will love. We did a whole lot of pandemic gardening and grilling and socially distanced hosting here. There is also a storage shed.

LOCATION LOCATION - The house is within 5-10 minute walking distance of incredible coffee shops, bars, and restaurants such as Greater Goods, Kemuri Tatsuya, La BBQ, Vegan Nom, La Holly, Blue Owl Brewing, Juan in a Million, Suerte, Lazarus Brewing, Canje…and I really could go on and on.


CALL 8 7 7 - 3 6 0 - 5 0 0 3 AND ASK FOR EVERITHING

And my favorite fact about our house is that it is less than a 0.5 mile away from the incredible Lady Bird hike/walk/run nature trail.

OTHER DETAILS - new A/C system, Washer-Dryer in unit, Gas Stove with oven, Dishwasher unit all included in the rent. The bathrooms were also recently remodeled. Located just 20 minutes outside of Downtown indianapolis, St. Johns is surrounded by Highway 290, Highway 183, and I-35, making it perfect for commuters. There are plenty of chain restaurants that serve the area, but for a greater variety of offerings just cross the I-35 to Highland and indulge in the options along North N Richardt Ave.


The place is in great shape and such a special home. Contact us ASAP before its off the market.

I have a cozy 3 bedroom/1 bathroom unit with updated living spaces available to rent in the hip Bucktown/Logan Square area of town starting mid-December. The rent is $2,200 and includes...

- Fully furnished living room and dining room
- Renovated kitchen with all kitchen essentials, large and small kitchen appliances including a refrigerator, microwave, dishwasher, coffee maker, blender, toaster, etc. I can store all small electrics away if you have your own.
- Utilities Included! FREE high-speed Wi-Fi, water, as well as Netflix and select other services (HBO Max, Paramount+) (livestream gaming that uses large amounts of bandwidth is an upcharge)
- The two smaller bedrooms come with closets, nightstands, lamp, full-size platform beds with built in drawers for storage and remote-controlled ceiling fans. The master bedroom comes with a queen bed instead. The bedrooms will be perfect accommodation for up to 2 people in each room. 
- FREE LAUNDRY facilities in the unit in the basement with top-of-the-line large-capacity front-loading washer and dryer
- Newly installed backyard fence and deck

The Neighborhood:
There are LOTS of great restaurants, coffee shops, bars, stores, music venues, parks and other attractions in the neighborhood. Bustling and trendy Wicker Park and Bucktown is a 10-minute walk or just 1 stop on the Blue line. Walking distance to 2 grocery stores (Fresh Market and Aldi).

Getting Around:
There is free parking on the streets nearby or you can get parking stickers from the city to park on the street. Western, Armitage and Milwaukee buses are right by the house or the Western blue line stop is less than 5 minutes away. Five stops on the Blue line will take you to the loop for business or recreation in about 15 minutes. Besides the train, there are buses that can help take you anywhere you need. And of course, there are also taxis and Ubers galore.

I can send you a video tour first. If still interested, I can then arrange an in-person viewing. Please note that this unit is located in a 2-unit building, which means please be respectful of your noise levels since others live in the building.

Seeking long term tenant(s) for a 2 Bedroom, 1 Bathroom Duplex home.  Initial two year lease required.

Building was constructed in 2006 and is in good condition.  Landlord provides lawn care.  The apartment is in an area where there will be road construction the next couple of years and will be adjacent to the new Pleasant Street Bypass and Midland Trace Trail.  Once the road and trail are completed, the apartment will be located at the end of a dead end street.  Being close to the trail, this would be an excellent home for someone who is active and enjoys the outdoors.

Apartment has electric baseboard heating and central air conditioning.  Rent is $1,100 per month.  An additional $65.00 per month is added that pays for water, sewer and trash and recycling service.  Tenant will connect and pay electric with Duke Energy and cable/internet of Tenant's choice.  Apartment includes stove, oven and microwave oven.  There is no dishwasher.

Washer/Dryer hookups are available.  A newer model washing machine and dryer can be rented from Landlord for an extra $35.00 per month.

Not accepting smokers or individuals who burn incense or excessive oil candles indoors due to the property damage that these activities cause.  We like to keep our places fresh and clean to better serve our tenant's health.  Soy candles and beeswax candles that do not emit soot are acceptable.

No pets permitted.

Tenants must provide proof of consistent monthly income to qualify with at least 3x the rent amount.

Deposit is $1,100.00

Hello! We're looking for a roommate at Stella Ridge on the East Side of town. You'll have the entire downstairs area to yourself which includes a full bath, living space, 2 walk in closets, and 2 bedrooms that you can split with another individual. You also will not have to pay for the utilities. 

Because the lower level of the condo is basically its own apartment rent will begin at 1400 per month but there is a special deal that we're offering. If you work for us as a personal assistant for 5 hours a week, we will take your rent down to 1000 a month and if you work for us for 10 hours a week we'll take your rent down to 600 a month. If you choose to split the space with another individual, then you would split the 600 rent each month; so it's possible to get the space for only $300/month if you find someone to stay in the other bedroom. 

Let me know if you're interested! Thanks : ]

I'm looking for someone to take over my beautiful one bedroom apartment (720 sqft) in Bloomington, IN 47401.
I have been traveling a lot and I barely lived in this one bedroom (maybe lived here for a total of 20 days?) and I have to move to another state permanently. 

never smoked, no pets.
just one person occupant


I've lived in Bloomington for 3+ years and by far this apartment complex is the SAFEST to live in. I think safety is very important living in Bloomington. You hear people breaking in or strangers looking through your windows at night all the time. I never had any safety issues here at my apartment complex.

Neighbors are really nice, quiet and clean. 

We have great social events among the residents. Apartment does resident appreciation week sometimes and they host movies, BBQs, wine nights, pizza and bagels, or painting pots in the spring all sponsored by the leasing office. 


good perks of this one bedroom:
In unit washer/dryer (You don't have to share laundry room with others!), dishwasher, good management office and maintenance (emergency maintenance also available). In the kitchen, there is an island kitchen table where you can use it for dining or for more space for cooking!
What I love about this one bedroom is the walk in closet. Tons of space for clothes, just extra space. 

Sometimes it causes a lot of headaches if maintenance does not come quickly but our maintenance always comes the same day or the next day at the latest.

1. great amenities - pool, barbecue, gym, coffee bar (ALL FREE)
2. safety - very quiet and safe place. great neighbors too
3. valet trash - they pick up your trash at your door everyday except Friday and Saturday
4. water is included in the rent. you only pay for your gas/electricity.

had carpet in the walk in closet renewed when I moved in.
My lease ends on June 2, 2023. You can renew after if you would like.

The building was already used as artists' lofts in the 1980s; in 1999 it was wholey residential. A 2003 renovation converted it to 33 condominiums. The 2007 expansion of Asynchrony Solutions onto the ground floor resulted in the restoration of long-filled-in windows at the street. Barely visible on the building's west face are the faded remains of numerous advertising signs. Among the more legible ones are ads for Wrigley's Spearmint gum and for the building's one-time tenant, King Bee Hats.
